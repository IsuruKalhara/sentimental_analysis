and outdated  n  the gift   directed by sam raimi  is a triedandtrue effort that surprises very little  and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings  to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front  to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond  nits fairly obvious who the killer is  in fact  i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions  nthe film ultimately shouldnt work  but it does  thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances  the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other  nannie wilson  cate blanchett  is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown  nsome of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale  hilary swank   who is severely abused by her husband donnie  keanu reeves   and buddy cole  giovanni ribisi   an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares hes been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father  nfor annie  she does not give the readings merely for money  but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyones future  nher late grandmother  rosemary harris  told her as a child that it was a gift she was given  and she should always remember that  nwhen annies eldest son is involved in a fight at school  she meets the niceguy school principal  wayne collins  greg kinnear   whom she finds herself attracted to

have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale  and the pond behind his home  n  the gift  may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level  but the performances and tight direction from raimi  who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film  s  for love of the game   lift the picture up several notches  nslowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights  the disappearance of jessica at the minute mark divulges the movies true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut  at times frightening  horrormystery  nat the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett  s  the talented mr  ripley    who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a runofthemill protagonist into a very exact  downtoearth  realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her  nblanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it  giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had  nwe follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing  both as a character and an actress  nblanchett isnt the only bright performer  as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year  nin her first role following her oscar win for s  boys dont cry   hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie  who seeks guidance from annie  but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all  to leave the grossly abusive donnie  nas donnie  keanu reeves  s  the watcher   makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie  so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all  nfor the oftencriticized reeves  whose acting abilities have never been the best  this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get  and it is also one of the better performances he has given  ngiovanni ribisi  s  the boiler room   is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend  and wants her to do nothing

stunning supporting turn  nher promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before  and she is radiant in her few scenes  nfinally  kim dickens  s  hollow man   makes her usual strong impression as annies spicy best friend  linda  nthe other notable aspect of  the gift  is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene its almost suffocating  nthanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski  and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young  the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent  but one that is filled with dread  nhelped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson  which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast   the gift

      "bbill condons  gods and monsters  is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale  ian mckellan   who made the horror classics  frankenstein  and  bride of frankenstein   nsince i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film  there is no way to know how accurate the film is  but i suspect that much of it only came from whales inner fantasies and hallucinations  nwhale  who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures  decided fifteen years before his death at age  to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him  nas the film tells it  during the end of his life  whale  at his large home in l  a   became infatuated with the tall  handsome  and much younger man  clayton boone  brendan fraser   who was working as the gardener at his home  njames whale  we learn quickly was  what many people refer to him as in the film   a dirty old man   nin one of the opening scenes  a young film enthusiast visits whales home to interview him and whale agrees  on one condition  for every question he answers  the young man must take off an article of clothing  nbecause of this episode  we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting  later making the excuse that his bright  white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off  nclayon agrees  and doesnt really think much of this  much to the warnings of his friends  becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past  ncertainly  the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall  since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man  even though boone is not gay  and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life  as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis  n  gods and monsters  is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast  due to his sexual preference  and never got the recognition he would have liked  since he longed to be referred to as a  motion picture director   rather than a  horror director   nand in one heartbreaking scene  he attends a party with boone being his guest  held by director george cuckor  and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore  nit is evident that whales first love in his life was making movies  and when his career ultimately fell apart  so did his passion in life  nas played brilliantly by ian mckellen  james whale comes off as a sad  but dignified man  and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others  just as long as he knew he was being true to himself  nhe never hid the fact that he was gay  however  even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession  and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person  nthrough the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone  boone  of course  only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to  while it means so much more to whale  who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life  nalthough boone is only in a deadend job as a gardener of peoples homes  whale views him as the ideal man  not only one that is goodlooking  even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings  but one that will actually listen to him  nsince whale lives with only his loyal  but disapproving maid  touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave   it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world  and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor  nalthough an extremely fine and mature picture  a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness  nit is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments  but it is a little thin  and the structuring of the  onagainoffagain  friendship at the films center is fairly predictable  nwe know early on where these two characters are headed  and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds  nin lesser hands  this setup might have felt too calculated  but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this  nalso  a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar  effectively played by lolita davidovich   but abruptly dropped and never brought up again  nif the film was not going to follow up on this side story  then it  perhaps  should have been taken out altogether  n  gods and monsters  is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture  impressively directed by bill condon  who  i sense  relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone  nthe film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end  nwalking away from  gods and monsters   it was ian mckellens marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me  and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably  nit is a sad testament when a persons true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them  based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life  which  ironically enough  is no one elses business in the first place

      "b    be warned    nthe following review contains some harsh language    nthe blair witch project  nquite possibly the least scariest movie of all time  nif you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace  because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy  nmy colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more  then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more  nand this worked for him  nwell  im sorry  but nothing    nis nothing      nnothing is not more  nits nothiiiiiinggggggggggg        ni do not pay  dollars to see nothing  n  nothing  is free  available all around the world at a location near you  ni am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary  ni could just discount them and say   well  i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow   nbut i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesnt hold water  nthere must be some other reason  n  then again  maybe my first thought is correct  i think ill try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction   nwhen i hear people praising this film  i never hear them talking about what makes up about  of this movie  three kids bickering with each other about being lost  nthey only talk about what might make up possibly  to  minutes of screen time  nthis being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout  josh    nover and over  nthis film should not be called the blair witch project  it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost    nand argue with each other  noh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting  josh     nand if you thought that was scary  wait till you see a pile of rocks  and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs  oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear  noh yeah  and some goo on one of their backpacks  nyouve never seen terror like this folks  and you dont want to  nthe chevy chasegoldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film  n  for current films  i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience   nthis film is an example of marketing with no substance  nthe marketing was brilliant  and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film  nthey want this film to be good  nand i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they dont have anything else to praise  nthat wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along  but this is not it  nthis film could have been so much better  njust think  if maybe there had been only  minutes of arguing about being lost  and  minutes of nighttime stuff  ni saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it  nshe was sold on this film  nand then  at one point during it  she turned to me and asked     are nwe supposed to be scared by this    nive heard one opinion that you  have to use your imagination  to create the fear in this movie  nwell  i thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do  nuse their imagination and create a good movie  ni mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay  bucks for it  nbut even if you like this idea  then what are you imagining  nan entity called the blair witch  nsome rednecks fucking with these kids  nare either of these things really scary when you think about it    nive heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something  nwell sure thats scary in real life  but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting  nyou could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary  but in a film it wouldnt be  nand no  a movie does not need a big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy  nactually the less the better  see the equally awful remake of the haunting   nbut you have to do something  nyou cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary  if it were real  nand by the way  about the shakycam filming in blair witch  narent these supposed to be  filmmakers  who should know how to point a camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly  nim not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified  thats justified  nim talking about the other  minutes of the movie where they cant seem to shoot anything smoothly at all  nminor quibble there  nthere is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers  nthat the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank  nand i think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves  what was i thinking    . \\nbut , if they don\\'t , then thats fine . \\nif it works for them then that\\'s okay i guess . \\ni just lament that by making this movie a hit , we are going to be subjected to more of the \" nothing is more \" approach . \\npretty soon we\\'re going to get some movies like this : just a still shot of a prison jail cell . \\nfor 90 minutes . \\nand we\\'ll have to use our imagination and think to ourselves , \" my god , wouldn\\'t it be scary to spend life in prison ? ! ! \\nthis movie is the scariest movie of all time ! ! ! ! ! \" . \\nor , a shot of a coffin , with some funeral directors arguing with each other . \\n \" man , do you know

      "b years ago  national lampoon introduced us to a new family  the griswolds  nin   the griswolds embarked on a crosscountry journey with the destination of wally world  a worldrenowned theme park in california  nwe laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured  ntwo years later  we watched again as they went to europe  and four years after that  we shared christmas with them  nnow  eight more years have passed  and the laughs have done more than die  ntheyve been cremated  nvegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold  the good intentioned but illfated father of two  nthe premise is basically the same  nclark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation  this time to las vegas  nhis wife ellen  beverly dangelo  and teenage kids rusty and audrey  always played by different actors  this time around  by ethan embry and marisol nichols  respectively  join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick  nof course a  vacation  movie wouldnt be complete without good ole eddie  reprised by randy quaid   the misfit cousin  showing up at all the wrong times  nthere isnt too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it  nits really just a skit movie  nthere are a couple of ways to define a skit movie  which is not a real term as far as i know  nthe first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours  therefore coming off like a two hour skit  nthe second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits  each lasting about five minutes  nvegas vacation comes off like the first  na good example of the latter would be last years black sheep  nthe problem with this format is that it becomes old fast  and it doesnt really fit into a movie mold  nin these cases  a  plot   which is generally very thin  is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags  i  e  nhave a good vegas joke  make a vegas movie   nsuch is the case with this movies miniplots  nclark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswolds money  ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton     rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage  and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie  shae dlyn  as an exotic dancer  nthe simple fact is  this movie isnt funny  nat first  i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes  but when the movie got rolling  my interest suddenly stopped  nchase plays clark griswold really well  nhe made the character and he is the character  ndangelo  to be quite honest  never was too impressive as ellen  and this movie doesnt show any signs of redemption  nas for the two new griswold kids  the word  blah  comes to mind  nthe  vacation  series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters  the simple reason being that there is nothing to them  ntheyre so generic  youll expect the credits to read  girl  as audrey griswold   nvegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor  nyes  its true that vegas vacation isnt even close to being close to being as funny as the others  which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways  but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart  nfirst off  why did they leave off the national lampoons heading on the title  ni couldnt find any reasons why  but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didnt want to be associated with such a lame film  nthats saying a lot  especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented  loaded weapon   pcu  etc  if they expected this to be another hit  you would assume theyd be proud to tack on the notorious header  but for reasons only we can guess at  like the movie sucking  they didnt  nthere is another difference here that makes an obvious impact  nthe first three films in the  vacation  series were written by john hughes  a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the s including mr  nmom  sixteen candles  the breakfast club  weird science  pretty in pink  ferris buellers day off  planes  trains  and automobiles  and uncle buck  nwowzers  nwhat a r  sum   nlooking at the names  youd think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the s  nwell thats not all  nthis guy also brought us s hits including the home alone series  the remake of 01 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber . \\nvegas vacation , however , didn\\'t have john hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious . \\nthis time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made-for-tv movies . \\nvegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made-for-tv sequel . \\nif this sounds like a wild idea , it\\'s not . \\nrevenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it . \\nvegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a . m . \\nsunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it\\'s quite out of place . \\nstephen kessler\\'s jejune direction doesn\\'t help things either . \\nhe only makes the film even more tv-movie-ish . \\neach consecutive \" vacation \" movie has suffered a drop in directing power . \\nwe started the series off with harold ramis , who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co-writing ghostbusters . \\nnot too bad . \\nthen we had national lampoon\\'s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits look who\\'s talking and clueless , as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high . \\nlastly we had national lampoon\\'s christmas vacation , directed by jeremiah s . chechik , who went on to direct the charming benny & joon . \\nkessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the short film birch street gym , which received an oscar nomination in 1992 . \\ngranted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal . \\nif you loved the \" vacation \" movies , and i know * some * of us did , there still isn\\'t anything here worth seeing . \\nif you loved them , don\\'t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of

      "bon rewatching italian writerdirector dario argentos much lauded murder mystery tenebrae  i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with  nin emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles  but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his  giallo  murder mysteries  nwhile its certainly not perfect  repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller  nthe story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal  anthony franciosa  where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book  tenebrae   nwith the police on his back for leads  he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems  nthe film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa  nhe brings grace  charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding reallife horror around him  nthe film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension  nargento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral  ambivalent  shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business  ntenebrae is perhaps the most multilayered of argentos scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here  nit may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play  nin that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep redprofondo rosso  the fulllength italian language version  and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes  nneedless to say for argento fans  there is no denying the directors brilliance as a stylist  nmany of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork  nthey are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light  rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria  ninstead  tenebraes set design and lighting paints a sleek  clinical  chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world  nand the soundtracks mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment  nso tenebrae has much to recommend it  no question  nstill  constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative  nsome critics argue that logic doesnt matter in argento films  but damnit  it matters in all films to the point where viewers dont deserve to feel cheated  nby the way  if you dont want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs  nabout an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which  properly handled  could have proved ingenious  nwe witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who  we later discover  is none other than the author peter neal  nhe is insane  apparently  nthe murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides its time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife  nhe is finally revealed to us as this  second killer  in the films bloody climax  nbut argento muffs the twist  both technically and narratively  nyou see  we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killers house  nbut thanks to poor editing  its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway  nbad cutting puts the timing way out  nin other words  hes almost in two places at once  nduring this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring  nby the films end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have selfinflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant  nthe injury  nhe banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock  nthus  the revelation of the  hero  as a killer  and antihero  in the final scenes may still prove shocking  but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled  nhelpfully  in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along  nbut there too is a problem  as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least  nthe story owes us a better understanding of franciosas mind  his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage  ntenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies  nfor instance  a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike  nwe would assume the rider is the same boy  but it turns out to be some male character we arent even introduced too  nthats careless filmmaking  pure and simple  nwhy  you may ask  do i go on about the storys flaws  nbecause when it comes to visuals and set pieces  argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world  ntake one of the extended scenes in tenebrae  nan upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where  almost unbelievably  it jumps a high fence and chases her across town  nfinally  as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine  she accidentally stumbles on the serial killers lair  nits an absolutely masterful sequence  tense and exciting  and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone  nand thats exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating  ntoo often  it seems  argentos films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts  nmind you  if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look  nand if youre a fan of argentos unique style of giallo thriller then its essential  nsee the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli  nits a stylish  greatlooking and quirky film despite the problem narrative  na shame  because it doesnt have to be that way  ntake argentos more recent stendhal syndrome     where with the aid of cowriter franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache  nproof that he can do it  if he tries

legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn  nwhen he first gets out  a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shootout  where he has to kill a couple people to survive  nhes constantly getting bugged by the government to see if hes doing anything illegal  and his lawyer finds himself neckdeep in a pile of shit  needing him to try and help him out  which includes him doing some prison breaking  ncarlito  like ratso rizzo  wants to go to miami  since  according to film logic  thats where its at   but needs some funding  nbeing a legend  he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club  this is the s  by the way  and since some of this takes place in night clubs  we get to hear all sorts of s classics  including several k  c  nand the sunshine band tunes  my personal favorite   nhe gets a bodyguard  the great luis guzman  at his best   and is soon running a pretty good business  even if hes constantly attracting underworld young thugs  like benny blanco  from the bronx   john leguiziamo   who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito  non the other side  the symbol of promise and hope  is gail  penelope ann miller  what happened to her    his girlfriend from before prison  nshes a goregeous ballerina  and a stripper  and soon carlito is trying to get back with her  and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami  nwhile this relationship is never fully defined or anything  we get a sense of love between them  and they have some truly interesting scenes between them  she never gives him addresses or locales  he always has to track her down   nall of these elements clash together at the end  in a brilliantly executed  emotional climax  which is inevitable  nwhen i say inevitable  i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack  putting a great spin on it  nsure  its going to eleveate some of the tension  but it gives the film a lot of depth  as carlito is seen trapped by fate  nwhats amazing is the big chase sequence  amazingly done by de palma  has a lot of tension and thrills  nlike  apollo    we know whats going to happen  but were still thrilled by what happens in the middle  nits also very emotional  thanks to a great script by david koepp  and amazing performances by pacino and miller  nde palma is famous  or infamous  for lots of violence in his films  nhis earlier flim   scarface   which starred pacino in the lead   has a ton of it  especially at the end  and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which im still not over   nbut de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes  nto me  the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building  looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet  nthis is the most brilliantly done  and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film  and probably the best in de palma film history  nwith a gorgeous soprano duet in the background  and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlitos head  and a saddened  remorseful look on pacinos face  its a tearjerker  well  for me  i dunno about you      nthe acting from all is great  especially from the three leads  npacino was panned for his performance  chiefly because his accent wasnt puerto rican enough and  well  it wasnt as  strong  as his oscarwinning role in  scent of a woman   nwell  his  scent of a woman \" performance was great and all , but it was nothing really but , as comic kevin pollack said , a \" foghorn leghorn impression . \" \\nin \" carlito\\'s way , \" he\\'s emotional , and strong , despite the fact that he\\'s remorseful over his entire lifestyle , which he cannot change . \\ni felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango-dancing , insult-throwing blind guy in \" scent of a woman . \" \\nas i said , penelope ann miller is great , and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry . \\nand they\\'re scenes are well-written , with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship . \\nand sean penn is amazing as the coke-addicted rat attorney . \\nevery scene he\\'s in , he has great energy , and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino . \\nin smaller roles , john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great . \\n \" carlito\\'s way \" is one of those films which you heard about briefly , but when you finally watch it , you\\'re absolutely blown away . \\nit\\'s a wonderful film , a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn\\'t do so hot . \\nbut trust me and check it out . \\nit\\'s a great little film , and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right . \\n'\n",

      "b  mandingo  has traditionally been seen as one of two things  either a muchneeded revisionist look at slavery in the south  or in the words of film critic leonard maltin   a trashy potboiler  that  appeals only to the sm crowd   nactually  i think  mandingo  is a strange combination of the two  although it fails on both fronts  nits too trashy to be good drama  but too dramatic to be good trash  nthe story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell  james mason  and his son  hammond  perry king   none day in new orleans  hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede  heavyweight boxer ken norton   nalthough the movie never explains it  a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley  naccording to the movie  mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves  nhammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him  nhammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves  nmeanwhile  hammond has married his cousin  blanche  susan george   because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild  nhammond  however  is happier spending nights with his  bed wench   the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex  nit is quickly apparent that hammond  despite his overt racism  is more in love with his bed wench  a sensitive slave girl named ellen  brenda sykes   than he is with blanche  nhammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had  pleasured  her before he did  nof course  its fine that hes slept with numerous slave girls  but the fact that his wife  a  white lady   had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her  nso blanche is usually left lonely and sexstarved while hammond is sleeping with ellen  nblanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child  nhammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a halfblack child  although its okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond   so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth  and hammond poisons blanche  nhammond then finds mede  shoots him twice in the shoulder  and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water  nyes  you read right  the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive  njudging only by the plot   mandingo  is pure sexploitation  nthe main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible  with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in th century southern society  nwhen  mandingo  was released in   it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail  this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs  ndramatically   mandingo  is weak and unfocused  and historically its mostly confused  nif one were to judge history by this film  it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality  not economics  nnot once in the film do we see any of the slaves working  except for a few house servants  nthe men spend most of the time sitting around  while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner  nthere is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves  but  mandingos  overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick  although theres plenty of violence  fights  vicious beatings  shootings  and the aforementioned human boiling sequence  thrown in for good measure   nsome tried to write off  mandingo  as a blaxploitation film  one of a number of quicklymade  lowbudget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies  but its not that easy  n  mandingo  was studiofinanced by paramount pictures  and produced by dino de laurentiis  the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as  the bible      the remake of  king kong      and the illfated  dune      nthe director was richard fleischer  a veteran who was best known for several special effectsladen action movies including     leagues under the sea     and  fantastic voyage      as well as such superior suspense films as  the narrow margin      nthe script  based on the supermarket bestseller by ken ostott  and the subsequent play by jack kirkland   was penned by norman wexler  who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on  serpico   njames mason  perry king  and susan george were wellknown and respected actors  mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt  , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career . \\nso why is \" mandingo \" so bad ? \\na number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job . \\nwexler\\'s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( \" yessuh , massuh \" ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( \" fer whut\\'re you gittin\\' outta bed ? \" ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( \" if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! \" ) . \\nfleischer\\'s direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable . \\nnevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due . \\ndespite its exploitative nature , \" mandingo \" was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery . \\nuntil then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery . \\neven classics such as \" gone with the wind \" ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter . \\n \" mandingo \" reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn\\'t all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets . \\nbut all this is constantly undermined by the film\\'s negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners . \\nwith a little more maturity and different handling , \" mandingo \" might have been an effective , worthwhile film . \\nwhile it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them . \\nthe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler\\'s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing . \\nthere is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but \" mandingo \" never does it . \\nsteven spielberg touched on that same topic in \" schindler\\'s list \" ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid . \\nthe difference between that film and \" mandingo \" is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma . \\n \" mandingo \" is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its \" trashy potboiler \" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished . \\n'\n"

anything id lose sleep over  nclearly  the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping  nis it then any surprise that  stigmata  is the dullest  most horribly executed piece of mtvinfluenced tripe i have seen in a long while  nno  not really  npatricia arquette plays frankie page  a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globetrotting mother  nas it turns out  the rosary belonged to a recentlydeceased brazilian priest  nthe priests church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan  gabriel byrne  because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue  nfather kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs  but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue  nhis investigation is soon called off  however  when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata  in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ  nfather kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie s story  considering shes an atheist  but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself  he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on  nhe eventually begins to suspect that his boss  cardinal houseman  jonathan pryce   is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church  nas it turns out  the dead priest had been working on the translation of a  fifth gospel  before they were excommunicated  nthe new rupert wainwright music video  n  n  ni mean film  stigmata  is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse  nindeed  it would have been good if it were a music video  because its only interesting for about five minutes  nim not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slowmotion  doubleexposure  and extreme closeups  whoaaaaaa       other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and  yes  he has been to film school  nhis camera trickery is interesting for a little while  but eventually  it becomes headacheinducing  nwhat this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue  such as it is   with wainwright screaming at the audience   see  nlook at what i can do  nim an excellent director   nmaybe then hed explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slowmotion shots of water dripping in reverse  or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying  ooh  scary    nif there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery  i didnt see it  njust when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story  here comes a doubleexposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever  narrrrrrrghhhh  n  n  nthen again  the superfluous camera trickery wouldnt bother me if  stigmata  had a story or characters that were remotely engaging  nthough wainwrights vanity certainly doesnt help  he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script  nwhere are plot continuity and character development when you need them  ncase in point  frankie page is the character that  i assume  we are supposed to identify and sympathize with  but we arent given any back story on her character  or any reason to like her  nthe extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hardworking hairdresser  who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building  and shes kind of cute  so lets start the bleeding  nthe fact that shes clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesnt help  either  naccording to frankie page  what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back  ngo clubbing  nsure  that makes sense  narquette  byrne  and pryce give it the old college try  but their characters are so onedimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking  nscenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat  because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable  neven though frankie pages life is falling apart before her very eyes  she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon  neven more curiously  he seems to be interested in her advances  nfather andrews religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic  nas for pryce  he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle   ill get you  my pretty   for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded  ntrust me  im not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain  nwhats worse  after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats  we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction  veers off in another  then another  and ends up being totally incomprehensible  nfirst of all , the film doesn\\'t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? \\nhow come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? \\nactually , i\\'m not sure what frankie was posessed by . \\nsupposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . \\nwhich one is it ? \\nthe answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . \\nfurthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . \\nif you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you\\'ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . \\nthere\\'s nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . \\n \" stigmata\\'s \" religion is so off-base that it can\\'t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . \\nif they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . \\ni\\'m not catholic ; in fact , i don \\'t care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . \\nit\\'s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as \" stigmata \" does . \\nit\\' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . \\ni\\'m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . \\nmaybe it\\'s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . \\nthe initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . \\nlike so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . \\nso much is overdone in \" stigmata , \" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film\\'s ( many ) flaws . \\ni\\'m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering . \\nwhen we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . \\nthe dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and \" stigmata \" is it . \\n'\n"

is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though shes never seen one picture of him  nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a nearriot  and rudy  who was to be paroled on the same day as nick  takes his place  which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy  so frenzied it kinda looks like rape  and a surprise visit from ashleys brother  gabriel  gary sinise   who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish cohorts  nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who  according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley  used to work as a guard in the indian casino  nthough by the end  the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything ive described might as well be irrelevant  nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on  several scenes in which  after catching his prey  the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid oneliner  nincluded  two    scenes of two    different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him  one following the other no less   nthough its an action film  the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on  incredulous as the audience  nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer  a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career  fell off the alist following a string of flops and now  in his old age  is slowly climbing his way back up  nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin  one of those almost but not quite movies  which followed the island of dr  morneau n  you remember  the one with marlon brando in mime makeup and a not so flattering moomoo   and now this  nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brainzapped mtv audience to pick apart  nproblem is these action scenes  nearly all failed escapes  serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play  ncharacter problems abound  rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre  the latter of which is not  at least at this point  something ben affleck is capable of pulling off  nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear  nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster  ncharlize theron  an extraordinary talent  is  like affleck  playing whatever part the script requires her to play  whether it be vulnerability at one moment  anger at the next  nshe never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes  frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this  ngary sinise has played this role frequently  and here  as in snake eyes  he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol  the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . \\nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience . \\n'\n",

rintintin of the th century  whom he rescues from his cruel  unkind master  nin addition  he even has a best friend  and future sweetheart  in the lovely  wealthy aloise  whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with lowerclass nello  n  he thinks hes not good enough for her  and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying   nbut then  he was a poor guy himself before he married  as mentioned later on in the film   none day  nello encounters a mysterious  yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande  played wonderfully by jon voight   who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart  and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist  nand every christmas  there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year  the winner getting a lot of money  neager to save his home  and his aging  dying grandfather   nello willingly decides to become an artist  asking aloise to pose for him  none night  the two travel to a circus  where they have their fortune told  one of the films most delightful scenes  that great happiness is destined for them  nshe gives the kids a ring  whom nello places on aloises hand  n   afterwards  the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers  nunfortunately  things are not all ladeedah in this tale  naloises father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again  nbad enough that they cant see each other  although we know nello and aloise  dont we    but thats only the start of nellos troubles  naloises farm is burned down  and nello is wrongfully accused  by the landord of his cottage  for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise  nthis decreases nellos reputation around the town  save aloise and her parents  and a kindly miller  william  who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by  nmatters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies  and he has to pay for his funeral  nbut then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home  for not paying his rental   permanetly  nthis means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold  freezing wind  nworst of all  the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time  the portrait of the princess  fails to win the prize at the festival  nnow nello and patrasche are really depressed  and close to freezing to death  nwill nello be able to find any happiness in his life  nwill patrasche save the day  nwill nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise  na dog of flanders is a delightful  heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages  neven older ones who consider themselves too sophisticated for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grownups  too  nthere have been other movies of this ilk  boy and dog   and while this one falls into that category  it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself  nmove over  or rather  roll over  old yeller  this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight  nthe cinematography  courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful  and really adds to the powerful drama of the film  nit also gives a feel of being in flanders  the whole film was respectably shot in flanders   nthe music from richard friedman is also remarkable  an evocative  poignant score that recaptures music from the th century  nthe opening song over the credits is very beautiful  i hope the soundtrack is available    and theres a brief excerpt of cheer up  charlie from willy wonka and the chocolate factory  sung by aloise  to nello  in another delightful scene   nthe cast is firstrate  jesse james and jeremy james kissner  who play nello  are some of the most endearing  adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life  so are the girls who play aloise  madyline sweeten as the younger  and farren monet as the older   nnot that they are the only good stars  however  njack warden is ideal as jehan  eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character  n  the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming  touching ones   nalso  bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william  nhes another one of my favorite characters in the film  nbut jon voight  as i mentioned before  is the perfect choice for michel  nhe brings a mysterious  yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he  can  win the contest  nbut what makes this film fun to watch is how welldefined the characters are  and the pace of the story  best of all  it has a happy ending  though i will  not  give it away  sorry  is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters  nfor the first time since the beginning of 999 , there comes a film which doesn't rely on popular formula stuff , such as big-budget special effects , commercial rock soundtracks , or any of that stuff . \\nthis one relies on telling a fully character-oriented story , with just the right amount of heart , humor , and drama . \\nthat , to me , is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful . \\neleanor o'sullivan of `the home news & tribune' noticed this , and was kind and generous enough to welcome it : `for want of a better word , a glow surrounds a dog of flanders . \\nits heart is in the right place and it engages you . \\nyou can guess where the film is going because this is well-traveled territory , but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner , an often-told story is well worth a revisit . ' \\nin addition , there were a couple of other enthusiasts , such as chicago-sun times and the washington post ( you should read their reviews ; they're really positive ) . \\nother critics , however , were not so kind . \\nstephen holden of `the new york times' had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing . \\nhe found the film to be a `sea of sugary bromides' and condemned mr . voight's character as `hopelessly wooden ? adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda . ' \\nin addition , `entertainment weekly' slam-dunked the film , condemning it as `the worst family film of the year . ' \\nthere have been so many other bad reviews like this , too . \\nmy suggestion : disregard the critics . \\nthey just have a big problem with touching family films , and one should never pay attention to them . \\nthis dog of flanders may only be a little `family' movie ( it probably won't be a big hit in the style of titanic , but then again no other film has been since then ) , but that is not a bad thing in and of itself . \\nthis is a story that is sure to warm your heart , and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders . \\nit is also one of the better family films around this year . \\nnone of the other films i have seen this year ( though they were good ) have been so low-key and touching . \\nif you're looking for family-style entertainment , look no further than this charming boy-and-dog yarn . \\ngo see it while you still can , for as i mentioned , it might not be a big bow-wow at the box office for a long time . \\nsee it while you can . \\nthere is really no need to compare a multi-million dollar blockbuster such as star wars : episode i ? the phantom menace or tarzan , or even the iron giant with a tender , sweet little family movie . \\n\"\n"

      "bsteven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities  because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits  like jurassic park  and  oscar  awarded critical triumphs like schindlers list  nhowever  in the s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories  none of them is close encounters of the third kind  extremely popular and influential sciencefiction spectacle  nunfortunately  it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars  nalthough both films have a lot in common  groundbreaking special effects  brilliant score by john williams  their future was different  one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon  and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow  nwhen spielberg began work on that project  he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit  jaws  ntogether with other young directors of his  new hollywood  generation  like kauffman  carpenter  hill and millius  he exploited the great creative freedom of s  when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment  nironically  it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of  blockubuster  philosophy  nbut in the mid s  many things were different  spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie  nalthough very personal  spielbergs screenplay was partly based on the book  ufo experience  by dr  j  allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww  nspielberg was not only inspired by the mythology  but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost  unmatched until the contemporary era of xfiles and the roswell anniversary  nthat was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic uforelated incidents as the element of the plot  nthe story begins with one of such incidents  team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u  s  navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight   nsuch events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary  richard dreyfuss   power company worker from muncie  indiana  who later becomes obsessed with his experience  nbecause of his obsession he loses his job  family and sanity  but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler  melinda dillon   single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction  nin the meantime  the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u  s  government  in cooperation with the french  led by lacombe  francois truffaut  begin with the preparation for ultrasecret project  nwhen the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary  he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area  nthere he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions  ntwo of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there  nspielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects  nthe slow  gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents   close encounters   is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale  nbut  instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws  we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder  nthroughout the movie the viewer knows that something big  magnificent and wonderful is about to happen  and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end  nthe last sequence  with its  even in this age  impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull  would leave many mouths open  none of the great virtues of this film is its optimism  naliens  who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in sciencefiction cinema  are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful  nit is very ironic  when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story  howard hawks thing and byron haskins war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind  nspielbergs humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era  the only hint of the contemporary gloom is postwatergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public  nbut  even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chainsmoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to xfiles and its more cynical and disturbing visions  nthere lies the main  and probably the only flaw of this great picture  lack of conflict  and consequently  lack of drama  nthe movie has few excitements or even action scenes  especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcocks north by northwest  but generally  almost everyone  neary  jillian  government  aliens  are the good guys  ndespite such shortcomings  the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles  nrichard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary  yet nice guy  who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale  nmelinda dillon was  on the other hand  nominated for  oscar  as a struggling mother  yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as nearys longsuffering wife ronnie  napart from visual wonders of this film  spielbergs semiofficial composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music  this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot  and as the basis for his score  nthe aliens  who are the main subject of this film  were visually very convincing  ntoo convincing  one of my acquaintances in the uforesearching circles said  naccording to him  the depiction of extraterrestrials as greyskinned little people with big eyes was so accurate  that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos  nso  they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien  this time designed to be anything but the real life  nthe result was e  t   for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times  yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts  nanyway  whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos  close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie  and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema  n\n",

that doesnt mean that he cant solve a highprofile society murder  nevery moment an exhausting workshop of ideas  and every character the same  the cavemans valentine is a concept so  high concept  that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment  with romuluss  caveman  a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlanes urban noir hero  spawn  nwith a longvanished wife  tamara tunie  acting as a spiritual guide  the occasional social caste commentary  the secret base in a cave  a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters  and a wickedly colourful archenemy  the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars werent inscribed with  gotham pd   nthat being said  the cavemans valentine can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy  a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart  nthe difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when  in fact  the cavemans valentine is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless  again like mcfarlanes spawn  while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts  nit is no small detail that our hero  romulus  is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life  in legend  without knowledge of his royal birth  but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park  in the romulus mythology  signs of romulus royal blood is brought by twelve vultures  while in the film  the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds  but of the carrion itself  nwhether or not romulus of the cavemans valentine will found a nation  or  in the case of novelist george dawes green  upon whose novel his own screenplay is based  a franchise  the fact remains that the cavemans valentine is easily the most misunderstood film of  thus far  nit  along with m  night shyamalans unbreakable  is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has  since millers seminal  the dark knight returns   redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics  nreaders of sam keiths brilliant  the maxx  comic series  or of mtvs shortlived animated adaptation of the same  are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne  nthe failure of both  the maxx  tv show and of the cavemans valentine  not forgetting the initial backlash against unbreakable  suggests that the public may not be ready for americas surprising contributions to dark fantasy  nluxuriantly lit  brashly saturated  and comicpanel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent  death in venice  ca   while inhabiting robin standefers  practical magic  mesmerizing sets  the cavemans valentine is an unremittingly gorgeous film  nkasi lemmons  following up her brilliant  debut  eves bayou  which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism  fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys  artists and suffering  nthe cavemans valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . \\nclearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . \\n_the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an

      "bas much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it  the more pleased i was when i left  nfirst  getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz   if you liked scream  youll love wild things   n  campbell gives a stunning performance   n  this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days   n  oh yeah  the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me  nnow  onto more serious stuff  and with this film  i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way   nwild things has singlehandedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa  nim not saying that in a bad way  but when you see this film  you may be shocked by what you see  nhowever  perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the films charming cast and tricky plot  that they let the film slide with an r rating  nbeing mormon  im bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film  ntrouble is  i have already seen it  nand i like it  nwild things is a film noir of the s  filled with s sensibilities  and yet breaking the rules and modernday taboos of s culture  nthe style in which it is filmed is rich in color  nthe actors are all gorgeous people  seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film  nsure  its all too good to be true  but aint it fun to watch  nwhen movies like this come along  sort of a better version of basic instinct  there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it  nthere will be people who dont want to admit liking what they see  but i tell you  most anyone who sees this will like it  nwild things begins at blue bay high school  the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into  nits almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance  totally based on looks alone   nof course  there are those select few who may look slightly ugly  but compared to the average person  they are gorgeous  nimmediately  the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time  nwe can turn off our brains  right  nwrong  nwhile you may be expecting one thing to happen  it certainly doesnt turn out that way  nthe film begins in a classroom  with nearly all the main characters present  ntheres sam lombardo  matt dillon   a counselor for the students  nhes heading the class discussion  ntheres also kelly van ryan  denise richards   a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam  nteaching the class  however  are two policemen  ray duquette  kevin bacon  and gloria perez  daphne rubinvega   who want to talk about sex    n  cheers  crimes  boos    n  what is a sex crime   nray asks  n  not gettin any   none student responds  nthis pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch  nhowever  upon hearing this  one student  suzie toller  neve campbell   stands up and leaves the room  commenting that they can both kiss part of her body  nand so  wild things sets into motion  nquickly  kelly begins hitting on sam  but sam doesnt want anything to do with her advances  nkelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him  nshe even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep  nsurprisingly  thats really all i can tell you about the plot  nany more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists  nand whats more  these plot twists are actually unpredictable  ngoing along the way of scream  wild things maintains that films surprises  and then adds even more to them  nthere are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen  nand even though you think you may get tired of them  the surprises are so genuine that its rather pleasing  ngoing back over them in my mind  nearly all of them work  though some stretch the boundaries of belief  nthankfully  the convoluted plot doesnt give us much time to think about each one  pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off  nas for the critics who complain that the film is trashywell  it is  nthis is pretty much just one trashy film  nhowever  it is the kind of trashy that isnt hard to watch  nits good trash  in a sense  none  the screenplay knows that its not to be taken seriously  and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story  nthis varies everywhere from kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running . \\nbill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs . \\nand two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed . \\nwild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn\\'t ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries . \\ninstead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don\\'t worry . . . \\nit\\'s not as graphic as you might think ) . \\nthe heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon\\'s full-frontal nude scene . \\nit\\'s very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it . \\nand , for as long as i can remember , i don\\'t think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it\\'s not completely , but judging from the audiences\\' reaction , it was more than they expected too ) . \\nalso , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon\\'s characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it ) . \\nwhat first made me want to see wild things was its cast . \\nneve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released . \\nhere , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead . \\nthe closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) . \\ncampbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent . \\nyou can tell she will be around for a long time . \\ndenise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range . \\nhere , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers . \\nhopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability . \\nand then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies . \\nshe gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half . \\ntowards the end she does get a bigger part . \\non the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist . \\nkevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it . \\nyou must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen . \\nand judging from many of the women\\'s reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) . \\nand then there is bill murray . \\nhis performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film . \\nas a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi . \\ndirector john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works . \\nhis direction is smooth and stylish . \\nthe visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air . \\nhowever , he seems more at home when the actors aren\\'t talking . \\nhis fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards\\' climbing out of the pool is a highlight . \\nthe cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures . \\nthen , there is the music . \\nthis was probably the most obvious thing to me , as it set the perfect mood for the film . \\nit\\'s hard to describe in words , so just see the film and listen to it . \\nit\\'s wonderfully composed and presented . \\nand be sure to stick around during the closing credits ! \\nmcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) . \\nhe has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events . \\nsome may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot , but it\\'s an entertaining way to finish the film . \\nplus , there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun . \\nwild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality , nudity , language and violence . \\nagain , the nudity is rather unnecessary , but let\\'s face it--people want to see it . \\nso why not give it to them ? \\nneve campbell , admirably , has a no-nudity clause in her contract , and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off ( way to go , neve ! ) . \\nthe sex scenes are graphic , especially the first one we see , between the mother and one of her deck hands . \\none almost wonders how they got away with the r rating . \\nthe language is quite harsh too , ranging from sexual innuendo to your average , everyday profanity . \\nand i can\\'t stress it enough : don\\'t allow kids under 18 to see this film . \\nthe target age for the movie is the 18-24 range , and that\\'s who should see it . \\nit\\'s definitely not for those under 18 ! \\ndid i mention that this film is rated r ? however , for those that do get a chance to watch it , you will probably more likely be pleased , and may even take friends to see it the next time . \\n'\n"

\\na pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a \" wacky \" demise . \\nthere is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye\\'s , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) . \\nfinally , just one word : monsters . \\nfaye dunaway and peter o\\'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o\\'toole overacts he\\'s entertaining and when dunaway does it she\\'s annoying ( her character actually says the line \" seize them ! \" \\nat one point ) . \\ndunaway\\'s henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty\\'s otis character from the first two superman movies . \\nhelen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she\\'s written to be , as she\\'s able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable . \\nbelievability aside though , it\\'s still annoying . \\nnow despite all this negativity ( and i\\'m not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! \\nthey have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . . \\nyet i\\'m still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) . \\nthe first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters . \\nthe movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory . \\nextras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and \" special project consultant \" scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries . \\nthe transfer on this international version is incredible . . . \\nyou\\'d think you were watching a new release . \\nimages are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . \\nonly some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn\\'t much that can be done about that ( unless you\\'re obsessive like george lucas ) . \\nthe new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you\\'ll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams\\' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films\\' golan-globus production ) . \\nthe commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries . \\nbosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there\\'s no dead air on the track . \\nbosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation . \\nalthough , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn\\'t get that response . \\nwe learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the \" almost \" appearance in the film by christopher reeve . \\ngreat detail is given about superman\\'s proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out . \\nas it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission . \\nfor the sake of brevity , i won\\'t even get into that one . \\nszwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy \" whimsical fantasy \" nonsense . \\nbosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office . \\nagain , for the sake of brevity , i won\\'t even get into that one . \\nanchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set . \\ndisc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release . \\ndisc two features the never before seen director\\'s cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long . \\nthe additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don\\'t add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o\\'toole\\'s screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) . \\nthe print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won\\'t care . \\none question though . . . \\nshouldn\\'t the director\\'s commentary be on the director\\'s cut of the film ? \\ni\\'d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . \\ni was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it . \\nso when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . \\ni knew the film wasn\\'t beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . \\nas the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . \\ncome to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . . \\nso i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started . \\nat the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city . \\nugh , i give up . \\ni\\'m surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs . \\nsupergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie . \\n[pg] \\n'\n"

      "bin intolerance  d  w  griffith told four different historical stories at the same time  cutting from one to the other  neach of the stories builds to a fastpaced climax  nin magnolia  paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others  nyet the stories and where they are going are all independent  nwhat is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized  neach story builds to a tense moment  or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment  but then lets the tension dissolve  nwhile the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along  even though they are not in the same scene  nthen toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again  nit is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked  nthis creates some strange effects  nthe stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships  nthe strands have varying degrees of bizarre content  nwe have the story of a dying man earl partridge  jason robards  wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends  nphil parma  philip seymour hoffman  is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal  npartridges young wife linda  julianne moore  is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies  but for an unsuspected reason  nfrank mackey  tom

exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector  jeremy blackman  and former quiz kid donnie smith  william h  macy   nthe film juggles all these stories for over three hours  but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily  neach story moves toward a single bizarre common climax  but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story  nthe common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories  nthe film seems to be built around strange events and weird history  but it really has little to do with the content of the stories  though they all are connected in part by one weird event  nmagnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson  though in my opinion his two previous films  hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories  nit is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from andersons company  njohn c  reilly seems to be a standard fixture  nparticularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight  nhere he several of the characters are mesmerizing  but that characteristic is not really used  nas studies of characters these stories are each worth following  nas wellrounded stories with a beginning  middle and end  they leave something to be desired  nbut the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through  ni rate it a  on the  to  scale and a low  on the  to  scale  nheavy spoiler    nheavy spoiler    nheavy spoiler    nheavy spoiler    nduring the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen  nand in actual fact  it does  nsince biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods  nit is  however  a perfectly natural  if somewhat unnerving  phenomenon  nthe cause is associated with whirlwinds  nwe know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air  holding them aloft  nthe reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister  nsmaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are  nwhen the whirlwind is over water  animals near the surface  frequently fish and frogs  may suffer the same fate  nessentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind  held aloft by updrafts  and finally dropped elsewhere  nso while the rain is possible  some doubts do creep in  nthe rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs  nit seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped  nit is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon  n  frankly i have no idea on these points   notherwise the event was quite believable  nwhat we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano  nin the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus     n  and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people  and upon all thy servants   nhowever a rain of frogs  though it feels biblical  is most definitely not a biblical portent  nnote that the previous verse says  and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up      nso the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river  nthe only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation     n\n",
      "ba frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal  na soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nationstate against another  na common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain  na terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end  nif the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy  the violence continues  nit is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone  even total innocents   anywhere  at anytime that gives the figure his label  nedward zwicks the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states  nyoud think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines  narab terrorists kill american citizens abroad  and the u  s  responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack  nhowever  unlike the reallife tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin ladens camp and manufacturing facility  the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal  nin retaliation  the terrorists bring the fight to the new world  nunwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agentincharge anthony hubbard  denzel washington   who works out of the bureaus new york office at one federal plaza  nwhile investigating a series of bombings in the big apple  he encounters cia agent elise kraft  annette bening   also trying to uncover information  ngenerally  the fbi is charged with problems inside the u  s   while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm  neven spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country  nhubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory  but as the two form a tentative professional relationship  hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government  nthe original tagline for patriot games was   there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil   nhowever true  it was pulled before the movies release because it sounded too much like a dare  nrevisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states  the siege is almost an invitation in itself  because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america  nadmittedly  the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive  whos going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by twothirds    but the basic premise is still valid  ni liked the fact that this film rises above the basic actionthriller fare of good guy gmen against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order  nit provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arabamerican population  and that in an effort to find the terrorists  the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself  nin fact  about halfway through the film  when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city  the liberties of all americans are put at risk  nalthough it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign  the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups  nthroughout  the film maintains a conflict between hubbard  who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law  and general devereaux  bruce willis   who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully  nwhat results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act  utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides  nit actually gets rather heady at times  but its a credit to screenwriters zwick  lawrence wright  and menno meyjes that they dont underestimate the intelligence of the audience  ni dont know if its his tone or inflection or something else  but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great  nthis  combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the midlevel authority figure  makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable  nannette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character ive seen recently  and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable  nits somewhat unfortunate that her characters fortitude is broken at a certain point  but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range  nbruce willis is pretty much relegated to a toughguy role  always standing straight  and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face  nhowever  the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the films development  nnotable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad  a lebanese immigrant  nthe role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage  and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society  ndifficult to say the least  shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch  nperhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom  wings   shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night  nwhereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwicks favorite actor  he directed washington in glory and courage under fire   james horner seems to be his favorite composer  ni therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific scorewriter graeme revell  seven films this year already  over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabianthemed music  and horners record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irishsounding at most  nrevell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole  nits nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films weve been getting throughout the year  nmissteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes  nfor example  its pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick  nunfortunately  theres a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions  obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eyecatching  nin the middle of the city  and against no real opposition   zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than  feet from friendly troops  nverisimilitude really goes out the window at that point  nthe film also gets a little preachy toward the end  focusing on the ability of different races to get along  na noble gesture  the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously  nthese flaws are glaring  but they dont detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class  n\n"

      "bone of the responses those that enjoy  detroit rock city   probably kiss fans  mostly  might have upon first glance at the rating ive given the film might be something like   oh  that caseys gone and become a jaded critic on us  njust what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n roll movie like this   nim wondering the same thing  ni feel like i should have had a grand time with  detroit rock city   nits the sort of movie i wish i couldve had a lot of fun with  but i didnt  ni just didnt  nsurely this film isnt trying to win any major awards  so should i have expected an oscarcaliber film  nno  but i expected something  na funny joke  na clever prank  na plot development  nanything  nthe movie never delivers  nyouve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing  n  detroit rock city  is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent  minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the films existence  and its not a very satisfying realization  nthe film is about four teenage boys  all huge kiss fans from cleveland  trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit  michigan  nthats it  nthere is no big plot description in this review  because the movie has very little plot  nthe characters are hawk  edward furlong   lex  giuseppe andrews   trip  james debello   and jam  sam huntington   nthey have a garage band  ntheyre pathetic  like all garage bands  but they like kiss and they like rock n roll  so i guess that means we root for them  nthey have tickets  they lose them  nthey get more tickets  they lose those too  nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets  most of which backfire  ntheres not much more to it  nfrankly  it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film  when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys hands  only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity  noh  and jam  real name jeremiah  has a really  really annoying ultrareligious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency  nshe doesnt want them to see kiss  if you hadnt figured that out already  nits really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this  nweve got plenty of kiss  along with some acdc  ramones  and thin lizzy  nthen again   maximum overdrive  had an awesome soundtrack  me being the big acdc fan that i am   but is probably one of the worst movies of all time  n  detroit rock city  doesnt quite reach that level of ineptitude  but it gets dangerously close  nin fact  the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind  nbasically  the soundtrack has earned the film a full halfstar  which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back  except for marilyn manson  whose halfhearted cover of acdcs  highway to hell  sounds like something my neighbors cat coughed up   nits also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste  because it s evident that theyre all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie  nedward furlong has done far better work than this  and so has natasha lyonne  and so has lin shaye  but hey  theyve got to make a living in hollywood  npeople wanting to see kiss  and lots of it will probably be disappointed  considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song  ntoo bad  they might have provided some energy to this mess  ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasnt got much material to work with  so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning  nwe get an endless parade of quickcuts  splitscreens  zoomouts  zoomins  and rotating cameras  all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script  nits fun for a while  but eventually it becomes disorienting  ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at  the blair witch project  stay far away from  detroit rock city   because the witch has got nothing on this baby  ni havent felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since  armageddon   nand what about that script  nits written by carl j  dupr   which sounds like as madeup a name as i\\'ve ever heard . \\nif it is , i can\\'t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . \\na plotless , pointless rock n\\' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . \\nthe jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . \\nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . \\nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy . \" \\nthere is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don\\'t provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . \\nit\\'s as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ? \\nfunny ! \" \\nlook , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\nlook , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . \\ntwice . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\nlook , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\na word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren\\'t funny all by themselves . \\nthey must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn \\'t predicted them five minutes in advance . \\nthat\\'s it , i\\'ve said enough about this movie . \\nit\\'s a waste of time and money . \\ni liked the music , but don\\'t bother buying the soundtrack . \\ni hear it\\' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . \\nyou want to see this concept executed well ? \\ngo rent roger corman\\'s 1979 classic \" rock n\\' roll high school . \" \\nit features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more

a topic that cant help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media  nmovies  documentaries  and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on  such as strategy  politics  and victory  nits easy to forget war  in its most basic form  is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other  nforgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier  no matter what his rank or importance  is a real fleshandblood person and not just a number  n  saving private ryan  is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect  especially in its unapologetic  realistic delivery  nit proves theres a huge difference between battling and killing  nthe film opens with one of the most graphic  disturbing scenes in recent memory  nits world war ii  dday to be exact  and the u  s  military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them  nspielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality  ninstead of positioned cameras  the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared  nthere is no sense of stability  but of constant  anxious  and confusing motion  giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle  and just a vulnerable as the poor troops  n  poor  is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are  nthere is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters  nwe dont get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles  but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding  nthe nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated  but as people that must be destroyed because theyre there  nin the movies  the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch  but in reality that wouldnt happen  nthe men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies  nthey are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the wellsecured germans who can actually see who  what  and where theyre shooting  unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off  nperhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are  but that seems to be part of the theme  nthe film seems to rely on the audiences sense of patriotism  that the american military is  right  and good and that the nazis are  inherently evil   nthe battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold  a whole foot progression   and begin to inflict some damage  ni have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up  i couldnt help but feel some sense of joy and relief  nto triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure  but theres nothing cliche about the graphic  detailed  atmosphere here because it really happened  none of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is  and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting  nthe plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet  ntom hanks stars as captain miller  a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon  nhes never obsessive or any such generic  cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this  nhe doesnt want to be there any more than his men  but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out  nthe mission the film is concerned with is  as the title states  saving private ryan  nthrough a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker  it is brought to a generals attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of eachs death simultaneously  nwhen they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe  they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother  nits easy to sympathize with this situation  after all  no one should have to lose all their children at once  nbut finding one man in this war is  as miller puts it   like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles   nthe saving of private ryan isnt just a dramatic device  but a thematic one  nhis salvation represents the sense of innocence the country  the world even  was trying to convince itself it still had  nwhen millers company hears of the mission  they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead  but miller isnt so quick to shrug it off  nhe knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope  and now he has the opportunity to make someones sense of hope a reality  nthe mission to find ryan gives millers group a destination  but not direction  nalong the way many things happen to them  both good and bad  na few battles are fought  not to be major accomplishments for the war  but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice  nthe act of killing itself becomes one of the films major philosophical metaphors  nthe soldiers dont mind killing other soldiers in blind battle  but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go  they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses  nunfortunately  death is a fact of war  and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters  but here spielberg doesnt want us to think these men are invincible  nin fact  only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man  and the performances are good enough to make this method work  nalthough the characters are somewhat typical  the actors maintain control over the material at all time  nwhether theyre arguing with each other  telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always seem believable . \\nsure , there\\'s a zinger here and there , but war doesn\\'t change the fact boys will be boys . \\nif and when one dies we too can feel the loss , even though we hardly knew them . \\nthe final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous , violent battle sequence . \\nprivate ryan has been found , but facing four to one odds , can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive ? \\nthat\\'s not a premise for thrills , it\\'s symbolic of everything the film has worked for . \\nit would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending , it ends the way it must end . \\ni remember reading a \" calvin & hobbes \" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like , \" dad , how do armies of men killing each other solve problems ? \" \\n \" saving private ryan \" is the adult version of that question . \\n'\n",

interesting questions  such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life  or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake  nalthough these questions came

brisk  nthere was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show  just a few quick title cards  a few interviews  and then right into the show  and the movie  none of the first scenes is of the studio light falling  there was no token scene of trumans idyllic life before it falls apart  because it wasnt necessary  we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble  and no sooner  ntheres also no point in the movie where the plot slows down  nits a quick  straight shot to the movies end  nin terms of overall quality  i would compare the truman show to niccols gattaca  nboth films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds  nbut neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas  neither film  clicked  and became an instant

      "bmpaa  not rated  though i feel it would likely be pg  for martialarts violence   nwith three movies already  re  released theatrically in america  and at least three more on their way  jackie chan is one of the newest  hot properties  in action adventure stardom  and its just about time  nfor over twentyfive years  jackies been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong  thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy  n  drunken master  has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to  make it big  this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong  nim not entirely sure why  exactly  nin many ways   drunken master  is similar to most of jackies other early films  such as  fearless hyena  i and ii   master with cracked fingers    half a loaf of kung fu    spiritual kung fu   and others  nin fact  looking at all these early films together  one gets the impression that they were stamped out  cookiecutter style  at a rate of four to six per year  all using the same casts and telling very similar stories  nto be honest  i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste  ntheyre quite different from action movies as we know them in america  nthese films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past  with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together  n  drunken master   though its plot is tighter than some  is no exception  n  as an aside   drunken master  was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw  and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen    in na movie theater in seattle  as part of an asian film festival  nat the time  i didnt really think it was anything special    but nafter having seen more films like it  its kind of grown on me   n  drunken master  s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies  such as  fearless hyena  i and ii and  master with cracked fingers  slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harshseeming master  and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end  a formula that has been  adapted   to put it kindly  by american films such as karate kid   nmore specifically  jackie chan plays the part of wong feihong  aka  naughty panther   a funloving  practicaljoking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good  but not quite good enough  nafter embarrassing his instructors assistant by beating him roundly  then beating up a bully in a marketplace  wong feihong tries to hit on a pretty girl  but discovers that she  and her mother  can hit back  better than he can    and nis further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt  respectively  nhis father  wong keiying  is unhappy about this  and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages  nkeiying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment  which feihong does not like at all  nwhile escaping from this punishment  feihong meets up with a drunken old man  who proceeds to thrash him soundly  then take him on as a student and thrash him some more  nthis turns out to be su huachi  a legendary master of drunkenstyle kung fu  nhe assigns feihong a series of bizarre tasks  such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame  cracking walnuts with his hands  and other such exercises  that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up  nthen  when hes ready  he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu  nunfortunately  the lazy feihong only practices six of them    n  drunken master  features some wonderful martial arts sequences  with jackie winning some fights and losing others  nits been said before  but ill say it againthese fights dont just happen  theyre as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance  and it shows  nin his fights  jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment benches  jugs  cups  bowls  fruits and vegetablesoften in new and surprising ways  nthe fight scenes  particularly those toward the end of the film  are unparallelled in most american films  nwhether jackie wins or loses  its really something to see    and nits often as funny as anything  too  nand funny is the other thing jackie chan is very  very good at  ntheres very little thats new in this moviejackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these \\nschticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . \\nbut they\\'re still hilarious as ever . \\nlikewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they\\'re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . \\nthe really big thing about \" drunken master \" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . \\ni\\'m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and \\nit apparently helps if you\\'re drunk while you\\'re doing it . \\ngenuine or not , i have to admit , there\\'s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what\\'s going on . \\ncome to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film\\'s success over any of the other jackie films . . . it\\'s \\nnot just martial arts , it\\'s the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , \" whoa . . . \" \\non the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . \\n \" gone with the wind \" , this isn\\'t . \\nstill , if you like martial arts films , or like what you\\'ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . \\nit\\'s much more \" real \" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . \\nyou might very well like it . \\nanother interesting thing about \" drunken master \" has to do with its video availability in the us . \\n \" drunken master \" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . \\nthere are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . \\nthankfully , \" drunken master \" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . \\nif you like \" drunken master \" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren\\'t really _too_ bad . . . if \\nnothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . \\ni particularly recommend \" spiritual kung fu \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , the \" fearless hyena \" movies , and \" snake & crane arts of shaolin \" . \\nalso , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , \" drunken master ii \" , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . \\nalso , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i\\'ve been told to suggest the \" once upon a time in china \" series starring jet li ( though i haven\\'t personally seen any of them yet ) . \\nif you choose to watch \" drunken master \" , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that\\'s out there . \\nall in all , i give this film an . \\n'\n"

self  kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film   ni dont think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan  nwell  it does contain this element  but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements  and seemingly more interesting ones at that   nthe devils advocate begins in florida with an

streak in court   the head of the firm  john milton  al pacino   asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer  nhe graciously accepts  where he is treated almost as a god  nhe is given an

claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends  na fellow employee is murdered in the park  and his mother  judith ivey  reveals information about kevins real father  nis it all just a big nightmare  nor is john milton really satan  playing tricks with kevins life  nthe devils advocate plays out fairly straightforward  but for some odd reason  the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we dont expect  nis this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed  nif so  the devils advocate messes up completely  and ironically  i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now  than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early  ni went into the devils advocate expecting a shocking horror film  and that is exactly what i got  ni was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally  and that is what i got  nbut what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending  did i mention that i didnt like the ending    nthe producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending  they pull the rug out from under you  nfilms like seen and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected  more or less  nwe know it is going to end in an unpredictable way  nthe devils advocate  on the other hand  ends unpredictably  not from us knowing a lot  but knowing nothing at all  nif that is confusing  i recommend watching the film  and then reading that again  nas for the film overall  i enjoyed the entire first two hours  being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study  nthe film runs like a wellbuilt clock  slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax  and an unpredictable one at that   nand then you settle in for a nice resolution  which does not occur  nit was at this point that i felt cheated  ntaking us on a terror ride of intrigue  we follow kevin lomax around  as he is the centerpiece of the film  neverything occurs from his perspective  nhe is our representation on screen  sort of   nbut we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game  ni dont want to spoil the ending  so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself  nperhaps the most shocking thing about the devils advocate is the extreme amount of everything  nit earned its r rating for a reason  nthere is plenty of nudity  sex  violence  gore  and then you have gore  violence  sex  and more nudity  nthis film really isnt subtle about anything  showing us everything  nit actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc rating  as it is quite harsh  nhowever  the movie does have its merits  and nudity and sex are among those  ni dont condone sex and nudity in films  but if its there  i might as well enjoy it  nthe biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch  nthe confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining  but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife  mary ann  nportrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron  mary anns problems are incredibly intense  and i found myself wanting to witness her decline  nthis may sound uncaring  but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her  nshe is the most interesting character on the screen  who is forced into a world where she is not wanted  \\nsomething the devil\\'s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . \\nthe story actually has something to say about humanity . \\nin one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . \\nhe comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . \\nthen , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . \\nthis semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . \\nwhat milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . \\nthese moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil\\'s advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i\\'m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . \\nwhen a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . \\nthe cast of the devil\\'s advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don\\'t expect . \\nheather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . \\nprobably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . \\nhe has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . \\ni have never seen him more believable to date . \\nal pacino is of course the scene stealer . \\nhis devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . \\nhe could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . \\njeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller\\'s day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . \\njudith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin\\'s past . \\nconnie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . \\none familiar face with a twist was \" coach \" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance . \\nthe devil\\'s advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . \\nat 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . \\nfor the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . \\nthe technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . \\ndirector taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . \\ni guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time . \\nbut just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream . \\npersonally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early . \\n'\n"

same era  betty boop  felix the cat  etc   a reflection of days gone by  nnear the end  louise is watching a cartoon thats a departure from the previously shown ones  nits a bit of audacity on jarmuschs part that is nicely effective  despite its surrealistic nature  nas ghost dog floats through his world  his life is touched by two people  none is a sage little girl  winbush  who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading  nshe comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities  just as louise ultimately does  nby films end  the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer  nthe other person in ghost dogs world is an ice cream  de bankole  vendor who only speaks french  yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog  nthe vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land  njarmusch  through rappercomposer rza  underscores his film with rap and reggae music  which at first blush seems dichotomous  but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie  nghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars  n  which  in and of itself  presents another paradox about ghost\\'s dog\\'s sense of honor . ) \\nthe head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation . \\nof all the cartoonish mobsters , he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world . \\ngorman plays sonny , a lieutenant who respects the old ways , yet has a quirky affinity for rap music , a love comically shown in several impromptu displays . \\nruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia . \\nhe is a husk of a man , assisted by two hearing aids , who barks out advice without truly hearing what he , or others are saying . \\nwhitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor\\'s use , his face . \\nghost dog is reticent to speak , often going for long periods without doing so . \\nthe fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent . \\nalthough the film has a deliberate pace , some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down . \\ntruly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob . \\nhe reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world . \\ncarried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker , ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon , into a figure that garners sympathy , if not a bit of pity . \\n'\n",

      "bso here is the second of s remakes of classic horror movies  nthe first was the dumb  pathetic but ok remake of the classic the haunting  nnow comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill  nthe classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people    to stay in his house  nif they survive the night they get the money  nif not well you get the jurisdiction  nhaving not yet seen the film  dvd on its way  i wasnt sure if i would really like the remake  nbut sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on  ngeoffrey rush  in a fantastic role with an incredible performance  is steven price  the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people  nhis wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends  nsteven dismays at the idea and makes his own list  nsomehow someone  or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party  neddie  taye diggs  an exbaseball player  sarah  ali carter  an exassistant who can rewire anything  melissa  brigette wilson  a talkshow host in sorts  dr  blackburn  peter ghallager   and watson  chris kattan  a smartmouthed humorist in ways  nwhat he is gonna do is pay these five people      dollars if they can survive through the night  nif they can they get the money  if not well they dont  nthe house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum  nyears before mental patients broke out and killed the dr  there  forcing him to lock the place up because if he died  so did they  neveryone who was in there burned to death  nnow it is steven prices home and he is throwing this party for these five people  nwhat starts out as a seemingly normal night  turns into a horrifying  blood splattering night  nthe deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed  nonebyone the people start to disappear  nconspiracies start to turn up  and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all  nthe people find rooms  which once held mental patients  nrooms which once had people dying  nrooms which may still contain these people  nnow these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house  and they must survive each other with terrorfying results  nsince i officially havent seen the original i cant say which is better  ni can say however i liked this movie  ngeoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price  and does a great job doing a vincent price role  nfamke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times  nali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs  nchris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines  npeter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims  nthe plot was well conceived and was very absorbing  nthe movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy  and even sometimes downright scary  ni found even the opening credits to me a little ominous  none thing i knew not to expect was a haunting type movie with special effects galore  neven though it had fantastic gore and special effects  the movie has only a  million dollar budget  which doesns show all the way through but you can tell  nthe movie was written well  and its only major flaw is the underdeveloped characters and plot holes that we are left with  nthe ending is quite clever and some may not even get it  ni must say house on haunted hill was a surprise  ni was expecting another haunting with special effects  no scares and a dumb ending  ninstead i found a good halloween movie with gore  scares and great acting  nhouse on haunted hill is one of those movies you really cant take seriously  nthough it is a wellmade movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws  nbut besides that the movie is fun  smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this cant be made all the time  n\n",

      "bwhen considering david finchers latest film   the game   four words come to mind  n  dont believe the hype   nthis michael douglas vehicle  from the director of  seven   isnt nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe  nthe film draws us in with an intriguing concept  aided no doubt by the riveting trailer  where a jaded millionaire  douglas  is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy  nthis isnt simply virtual reality  nthis is real life with a deadly twist  non his th birthday  nicholas van orton  douglas  is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother  conrad  sean penn   nconrad has a special birthday present for his brother  nhe hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services  n  they make your life fun   conrad tells him  nnicholas humors his brother  telling him hell call  but its clear he has no time for any foolish   fantasy roleplaying   as he calls it  nthen  for reasons that are never really made clear  nicholas decides to go to crs and see what theyre all about  nhe ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process  which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have  nnevertheless  when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client  the weird things start happening  nof course  when weve only covered about  minutes of screen time  what else should we expect  ndouglas has built his modern career around playing powerful  violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands  none of those films   basic instinct   came from the creative minds of writer  joe eszterhas and director  paul verhoeven  nthe premise of  the game   is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film   total recall   nin that case  the premise was implanting someone elses memories as a way to enhance ones own life through a dream vacation  nyet  in both films  the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience  nwe live the adventure along with the protagonist  reacting to each twist and turn  nin theory  the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isnt  nall we can do is hang on until the end of the ride  when the truth is finally revealed  nnow  for those of you who forgot  let me say this again  n  dont believe the hype   n  the game  is not a thrilling roller coaster ride  nas a suspensethriller  it doesnt do much but spin in circles  nby the third reel  i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot  nis it any wonder douglas wont be able to resist the charms of a mysterious  potentially lifethreatening blonde  ever heard of glenn close  nno  well  how about sharon stone  nthought so   nif anything in this film surprises you at all  i would guess you havent seen that many films  nthere is no suspense here  ntrust me  i looked hard to find some  ni had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations  nfincher aims for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas  nthere are those that might say  the game  is not intended to be viewed literally  ni would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film  nthe film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues  nthere is a moment early in the film where van orton  realizing his game has begun  smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out whos in on the whole thing  nhe is charged by his paranoia  nhe is looking at the world through new eyes  nit is the last thoughtprovoking moment in the film  nfrom there on  the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us  nany significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device  nat the outset  were told each  game  is tailored to the individual  nultimately  this  game  is supposed to work like a crucible  trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire  proving his soul  nyet  as douglas endures his personal gauntlet  were given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is  ni wanted to like this film more than i did  ni look at it as just anothergreat idea  poorly realized  ni can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didnt mean we were seeing what was really happening  nbryan singers  the usual suspects  for one  a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas  nalso  there is the underrated  jacobs ladder   with tim robbins  a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism  nhere are two examples of films that dont simply manipulate for manipulations sake  \\nthere are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place . \\none major issue that comes up in \" the game \" is whether or not the whole \" illusion \" is just a highly sophisticated con game . \\nwell , i can tell you right now , after you\\'ve spent your $7 dollars ,

      "bhistorical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early s  nfor many critics  scholars and  most importantly  film producers  it was a thing of the past  something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of blackandwhite television and noncgi special effects  nbut in   same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago  there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor  producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre  nand  same as in the case of dances with wolves  he was awarded for his effort with  oscars   nthe name of the film was braveheart  and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson  nthe plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace       nin his time  english king edward i  longshanks   played by patrick mcgoohan  has almost completely subdued entire british isles  including scotland  whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by  ius primae noctis  and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights  nalthough english had killed his father many years ago  young scottish commoner william wallace  played by mel gibson  doesnt care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron  played by catherine maccormack   nmurrons death changes that and wallace takes arms and  together with small but dedicated band of followers  begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country  nthrough time  more and more people join his ranks and in  wallaces ragtag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge  nbut the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves  especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce  played by angus macfadyen   who wouldnt like to have a simple commoner as a national leader  nbraveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson  so it wouldnt be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann  nhowever  even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre  nthe most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism  nwhile older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytalelike vision of picturesque castles  splendid costumes and knights in shining armour  gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard  short and brutish  nthis general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle  where handtohand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details  never seen since verhoevens ultranaturalistic flesh  blood  ncompared with this naturalistic approach  most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays  nbraveheart also employs humour at the right places  not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences  but also to underline its downtoearth atmosphere  so different from previous historical epics  nwhat makes braveheart  larger than life  is his protagonist  nmel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and  as a result  character of th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late th century comic book hero  nwallace is more than superior to his enemies  both physically and mentally  yet he is able to show his sensitive  more vulnerable side  nnaturally  when the character is based on epic poems  most of historical accuracy is going down the drain  which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in s   nhowever  even those who dont particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace  especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel  played by sophie marceau  and make her a child  nbecause of that the disbelief is hardly suspended  and final scenes arent as effective as they should be  nmel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful  and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors  nmost memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan  whose cold  calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema  nbrendan gleeson  who would later become famous for his role in boormans general  is also very good as wallaces trusted companion  as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosystricken king john balliol  ndavid oharra is very entertaining as wallaces irish ally  and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his consciencestricken character of robert the bruce  nwomen in this film have rather thankless roles  especially marceau as onedimensional french princess  ncatherine mccormack as wallaces wife was more interesting  but she was eliminated from the picture early on  nfrom the technical point of view  the film is also very good  nphotography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen  non the other hand  the musical score by james horner employs too much of modernday instruments for period piece set in medieval times  nalthough mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike  braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism  nthe main reason for that was the fact that gibson  among many historical facts  chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of  longshank  s son prince edward  played by peter hanly   nhe is not only presented as a villain  but also as one of the less competent in villains camp  and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in  politically correct  hollywood  nto make things even more obvious  good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward  rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals  nhowever  although the message of this film might look rightwing  it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in th century  naccording to that ideology  oppressed classes  workers  peasants  are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and  as such  they are more radical  less willing to make compromises and more efficient  on the other hand  privileged classes  aristocracy  bourgeoisie  are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges  \\nthis marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety . \\nin the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for

and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast  nthe performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired  nthe characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles  nlooking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they arent acting but are actually the characters in the movie  nthe casting for the movie could really have been better  in my humble opinion that is  none character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself  nyes  you read correctly  the ship is a character  nhow is the titanic a character  nyou ask well simple  a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you  nthis character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this  nmr  cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense  nall this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp  nnow  to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards  nthe effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking  nin some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there  you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening  if your imagination is good   nthe technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique  nthe movie will leave you amazed at the effects  and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie  just humans and an oversized ship  nthe movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions  the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes  nnow that is not a feat accomplished by most movies  now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch  i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end  nthe historical value of this movie is quite high  and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy  for it is extremely well done  nthe method of telling the story is also good  maybe not totally unique but effective none the less  nregardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at  nthe simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing  nif you get the chance to see this movie go    nit might not be the best movie in the world   nbut it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it  nduring none of the  hours and  minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie  n\n"

      "b  americas sweethearts  has an intriguing premise and a great cast  but it isnt nearly as edgy or funny as it should be  nalmost all the problems with the project can be traced back to

how billy crystal and cowriter peter tolan screwed up their own premise  the comedy in  americas sweethearts  is based on barelyincontrol people trying to contain themselves in the presence of

convincing one  by the way   ncatherine zetajones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic  nby casting himself as the publicist  billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on  comic relief   stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks  nin supporting roles  hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed  too broad   nseth green is amusing as a toadie  stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair  though he has little to work with  ncome to think of it   little to work with  is the operative

when i answered  john cusack   she replied with a rather stunned  who    as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to  nnow i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies  most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin  but i suppose its understandable that she would not recognize the name  after all  for most  names are tougher than faces  ni showed

quite as cool  nim sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as  the guy from  add in the cusack film of your choice    nhes not a brand name  and his movies usually arent big moneymakers  but in his own unassuming way hes kind of a genius  nwith his pleasant  common man looks  and charming semiarticulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the s  nfrom the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon  ndespite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it  the schlumpy every man   hes a constantly enjoyable screen persona  like albert brooks or woody allen  nand he knows how to chose scripts  while the stephan baldwins and val kilmers seem to put them selves in everything  the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle  and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent   cusack generally picks rewarding projects  save for the unwatchable hot pursuit  a  film also featuring a young ben stiller   nhigh fidelity is his second

hipster ode to the noncommittal rob  a vinyl record store owner  who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his  top  break ups list   nthis is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris buellers day off  nat first the talkingdirectlyintothecameraschtick had me vaguely annoyed  mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit  but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusacks witty delivery  nhes the kind of guy we dont mind talking directly to us  ngradually the film settles into a shampoolike tragicomic character study  of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is  yes its all very existential   nthough that plotline is mostly enjoyable  the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters  all of whom  now this is really something  are terrific enough to warrant their own films  nthe best of which is jack black  of the very funny show tenacious d  a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis hair    unfortunately that annoying smirk remains   an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy  nhes the kind of guy im sure weve all met before  a blowhard who thinks hes always right and will do anything in his power  be it yell  argue  insult  to hoist his opinion onto others  nbut i like this guy  because of how black plays him  nthe actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes  but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak  which might be a bit of a redundant description  seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic   \\nhe\\'s the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films . \\n ( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister ) . \\nbut fears and black never let that happen . \\nthe character , for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality . \\nhe\\'s over the top , but in a way we can all probably relate to . \\ncatherine zeta-jones , in her brief role , gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own \" charm \" . \\ntim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age-type , a character played entirely for cartoon yuks , but still manages to work its desired comic effect . \\nthe one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy , the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle ( mifune ) , who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent , replacing it with a stilted american phonation . \\ni give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role , but instead of being likeable , she comes across as rather robotic , and as such it\\'s hard to see why cusack\\'s character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful , intelligent writer ( natasha gregson wagner ) potentially waiting in the wings . \\nthis reminded me of say anything , where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye , and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood ( whose unbelievably more wooden then father , clint for those \" special people \" whose wheels turn a little slower ) . \\nin fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his , though i\\'d bet that if laura and natasha switched roles , the result would be more effective . \\nhigh fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances . \\nfears\\' direction is somewhat stilted , and the script is sometimes a little too ( and this is a word i\\'m beginning to hate to use but alas i must ) quirky for its own good ( i think i\\'ll blame that on scott rosenberg , who judging from what he did with beautiful girls , con air , and things to do in denver while your dead , has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie ) . \\nbut cusack really does deserve an award , for being so damn ? ? ? cusackian . \\ni\\'m afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent . \\nhis character , rob ( whose sort of like an older , more bitter lloyd from say anything ) is funny and tragic without being pathetic , and that cusack can do all this , and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences , is something of an achievement . \\n'\n"

      "bwonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you  nyou can see its plot developing from a mile away  you nare lured into its benign story of a single yearold girl looking for a soul mate in boston  as that city is depicted as a miniwonderland for singles  nthis is a star oriented film  and the star who carries the film is erin  hope davis   nthat this is a dating film  about singles who for reasons of fate or luck  or whatnot  have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers  is nothing new  this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films  nthe fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film  the nmain quirk in the plot here  is that hopes pushy mother  hollan  visits her in boston  sees her daughters livein relationship with a radical protester  hoffman  breakup and decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper for her harvard medical school dropout daughter  who works as a nurse  nthis is done without her knowledge  nit is cornball sitcom stuff  but  at least  it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director  nit is easy to like erin  she is bright  caring  and attractively blonde  nit is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with  the financially strapped  ruggedly handsome  intelligent yearold alan  alan   who no longer wants to work with his father as a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be a marine biologist  nof course  he comes across as being so good  though  he does kill some fish in the aquarium   that it is hard to believe hes for real  or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for  nthe contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as  the subway  at a restaurant  or on the phone  nalans brother answers erins ad with a few of his pals  as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way  making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her  that the others witness  will win the bet  nthis subplot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told  nthat we have to see erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are  each one more annoying than the other  culminating in the most obnoxious one of all  that brazilian lover  jose   who is about as charming as a snakeoil salesman  who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in brazil  was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story  nanyway  as expected  alls well that ends well  for this watchable piece of fluff  that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its storyline  nthe dialogue was actually not bad  those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation  nand  oh  by the way  wonderland refers to the stop on the boston metro  it is where greyhound racing takes place  n\n",
      "blogical time travel movies are a nearimpossibility  nconsidering that the skeptics best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities  writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task  noccasionally  we get a film that does manage it  nterry gilliams   monkeys  was one such film  nbut more frequently  we get films that dont much deal with it at all  nthere is one question to ask in this case  does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies  nthe  terminator  films made up for them with exciting action   back to the future  did it with an entertaining story  and the new film  frequency  pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own  nis  frequency  filled with plot holes  nyes  ndoes it matter  nnot really  nthe film opens in october of   nfirefighter frank sullivan  dennis quaid  puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job  then goes home to his loving wife julia  elizabeth mitchell  and son johnny  daniel henson   nthe doublepronged story flashes forward to   where johnny  now jim caviezel  is all grown up and working as a police detective  na strange occurrence  the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city  allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in  and that john has found in the present day  nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea  john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire  and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom  nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive  john is initially overjoyed  until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous  a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women  nfrank and john now must work together to set things right  with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past  nthe premise of  frequency  is unusual  and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept  john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions  nthis isnt explained  you just have to go with it  nwhen frank doesnt die in a fire  john is the only one who remembers it differently  while everyone else remembers it the new way  nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities   and   are to each other  nsometimes franks changing the past results in something happening right away in johns world  and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time  nnow  the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this  and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted  but nevertheless logical  if i thought about it hard enough  for example  the reason john gets advance information of the serial killers murders was because the change had already happened in franks world  and john is only witnessing the  projection  of that change   but explanations arent really the point  nwhen  frequency  gets cooking  its a riveting little thriller  even if it is confusing  nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment  and  frequency  works as long as it keeps moving  nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion  ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure  frequency  as good hollywood entertainment  establishing decent  likable characters  making us care for them  and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved  ni liked many of the creative touches  the split screens  allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities  and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward  nit actually uses the  metsorioles world series  the one that featured the amazin mets  to great effect  frank uses johns advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him  n  admittedly  this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself   ni even liked the final scene  which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods  nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing  as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious  but it does make sense if you think about it  and give the script a lot of leeway   and lets face it  its a darn cool way to end the film  nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in  frequency  to keep you on your toes  and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant  nthe other major thing to appreciate about  frequency  is the handling of the fatherson relationship  nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily  its a rocksolid job from both actors  nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept  how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative  or with a future descendant  nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question  nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film  if we dont believe in the characters  we dont care about the outcome of the thriller plot  nhere  we do care  because we like the lead actors  ni also liked some of the supporting cast members  nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles  playing julia the doting wife  and  mother  but still performs admirably  nandre braugher  late of the television show \" homicide : life on the street , \" gives a nice supporting turn as frank\\'s best friend and future colleague of john . \\nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank\\'s world series predictions come true before his very eyes . \\nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . \\nperhaps the only thing i didn\\'t like about \" frequency \" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera\\'s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . \\nbut that\\'s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . \\ni freely acknowledge that \" frequency \" may best work as a \" guy \" movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of \" field of dreams \" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . \\nwho wouldn\\'t want to speak with a long-dead parent ? \\nor see how their children turn out ? \\n \" tell me about your life , son \" -- excuse me while i mist up . \\nand don\\'t call me a sissy . \\n'\n"

      "bcountries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously  had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally  nluckily  movie reviewers arent burdened with such legislation  notherwise  small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer  nin case of star wars   science fiction epic by george lucas  the consequences would be even more severe  because that film is very special for tens of millions  if not hundreds of millions of fans  nin any case  objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews  because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best  if not the best film of all times  nthose who dont usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery  nthe author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold  objective standards in reviewing this film  nlike so many previous reviewers  i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago  and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since  nperhaps it was childlike fascination with  until then unimaginable  wonders that happened long time ago  in a galaxy far away  nor perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots  with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before  nanyway  watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life  nand it was also unmatched for many years to come  because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas epic  nstar wars wasnt just important movie for me  or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment   nit was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema  nuntil than  american motion picture industry was in a limbo  social turmoil in s practically destroyed the old hollywood  and new authors filled the void  mostly by using hollywoods financial and technical resources to create serious   personal  or  artsy  movies  nas a result  audience  traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate  didnt want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen  ngeorge lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue  nthe audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm  and huge financial success of the movie  later backed by supplement industry of toys  books  comics  role playing games and other merchandise  slowly began to change the face of hollywood  nserious  adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion  and were replaced by industrial products of  blockbuster  philosophy  none of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre  nuntil   science fiction movies were mostly in bproduction domain  nin late s  bigger budgets for science fiction didnt look so strange anymore  thanks to the great success of   a space odyssey  nbut the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism  and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production  mostly dark  dystopic movies  nhowever  in  star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies  even among the audience that usually doesnt like it  nas a result  seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away  although some good  dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early s  nafter that  science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment  nironically  the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of  new hollywood  generation of young movie authors who made  artsy  and  personal  films in early s  ngeorge lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx   and nostalgic drama american graffiti  nboth movies were considered  personal  in its time  despite latter one becoming very popular  nin a sense  star wars is an also very  personal  film  and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it  not for it  nbut unlike many  personal  movies of the era  its  personality  was in line with the wishes of the general audience  nthe plot  set  a long time ago  in a galaxy far away   begins in a time of civil war  nthe evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic  nin order to quash any opposition  the empire had built death star  superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets  nthe information about death star  acquired by rebel intelligence  is being transported by princess leia organa  carrie fisher  when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser  nprincess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader  played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones   but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots  cpo  anthony daniels  and rd  kenny baker   nthose two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker  mark hamill   young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot  nhis adventure begins when rd escapes  because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi  alec guiness   nold man is actually the last surviving jedi knight  member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force  nafter some hesitation  luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess  while the old man would teach him the ways of the force  ntheir small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely  where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo  harrison ford  and his furry sidekick chewbacca  peter mayhew   ncritics who dont like the movie  especially those who cant forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of  new hollywood  , are prone to point the lack of originality . \\non the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa\\'s samurai classic the hidden fortress . \\non the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) . \\nthe others would find the author\\'s element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes . \\neven out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art . \\ngeorge lucas\\' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well-paced segments between action and dramatic buildup . \\ncharacters are well-drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster . \\nwe have a \" coming-of-age \" hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters . \\nsome of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form . \\nunfortunately , the same can\\'t be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career . \\nthe thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology . \\noften comparisons with 2001 : space odyssey , another ground-breaking sf film , were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas\\' superiority over kubrick . \\nhowever , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they aren\\'t the most remembered trademark of the movie . \\nthat honour should definitely go to the \" oscar \" -winning soundtrack by john williams , whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career . \\nnewer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release . \\nyet , even if they are immune to the george lucas\\' magic they should watch this film nevertheless , perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture . \\n'\n",

      "b is dull  perfunctory  uninspired  and boring  na greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives  flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors  ni  however  would rather cut to the chase  n is dull  perfunctory  uninspired  and boring  nthere is nothing in it  not a glimpse of depth  nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight  nthere is no electricity in any of the scenes  or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots  nand its underdeveloped  and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think theyre in this years boogie nights  nthey are so wrong  nthe picture has been assembled by mark christopher  nbased on this film  i dont know how he got a job in the business  n is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name  which originated in the s and closed down in the s  ni dont know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released  but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas andersons brilliant work in every possible way  from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography  nwhat it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great  depth  intelligence  energy  fascinating characters  and challenging themes  n cant even measure up to the last days of disco  which is flawed  but still smart and entertaining  nits remarkably bad timing  id say  to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind  ni have exaggerated  though  there is one interesting character  and one terrific performance  nthat character is steve rubell  played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves  nsteve rubell is the owner of studio   and if christopher had focused on him  then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself  nalas  we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane  ryan phillippe   a goingnowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club  thanks to rubells homosexual impulses  nits here that he meets his friends  the array of uninteresting characters  his coworker  greg  brecklin meyer   his wife  anita  salma hayek   and  of course  the love interest  julie black  neve campbell   nshane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning  and he has a reasonably sturdy home life  n  some of the scenes with his father border on interesting  while heather matarazzo  who plays his sister  pushes phillippe off the screen   nbut he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene  and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs  nwhy his  friends  push him into drugs is never really explained  but the fact that they are  friends  is questioned only is superficial ways  greg gets really mad at shane because hes been elevated to bartender status   nthere isnt a single conflict that takes center stage  except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works  nmost of the film is dumb  and most of the dialogue is inane  ntheres a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black  and  in the next scene  theyre arminarm without a bit of development  nthen  theyre kissing in a bowling alley  nthis is five minutes of material  thrown into the picture at the last minute  well past the onehour mark  and this isnt a long film to begin with   ncampbell is a talented actress  but she needs a role that gives her a little depth  nthis one doesnt  nand phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever  this performance pales in comparison to mark whalbergs starmaking role in boogie nights  nhe seems dumb and misguided  and his voice never changes tone  ni guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body  but he seems pretty lanky to me  nhes all wrong for a lead role  but it doesnt help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters  nby the end of   shanes most notable trait is his stupid  fake accent  nthe rest of the performances are wasted  nhayek is an energetic  talented young actress  and does almost nothing here  nmeyer is endearing  but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard  nonly myers  by sheer force of talent  manages to rise above christophers wadingpool of a script  nrubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters  but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance  nin fact  myers is the sole reason to see   and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him  nive read that studio  has been recreated down to the last detail  nfrankly  i dont care  \\nit\\'s easy to recreate something technical like this . \\na fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task . \\nbesides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway . \\naside from myers\\' performance , 54 is a complete failure . \\nit\\'s dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \\nsome may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they\\'re so obvious to me . \\nin any event , 54 is pallid without the contrast . \\nit doesn\\'t even work as mindless

      "bthere is a striking scene early in  city of angels   where all the angels who live unseen in our midst  gather at the beach to watch the sun rise  nthe camera moves above them  showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women  all garbed in black  nthen the camera moves in on the face of seth  an angel played by nicolas cage  and as the sun rises  he smiles and his entire face lights up  nyou see  the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets  but they cannot feel a human touch  nit is an important scene for several reasons  nfirst of all  it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible  nthe film presents these fantastic beings as normallooking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth  watching what goes on with little interference  nthere are none of the standard  hokey angel references used in recent films like  angels in the outfield     or  michael      nthe angels here are stark and believable  nthis early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition  for its shows how gods angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot  and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures  like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs  or the smell of the salt in the air  nthere is an inherent tragedy in being an angel  although there is much beauty in it as well  nthey eternally walk the earth  listening to our thoughts  touching us in our pain  and leading the dying to heaven  nlike human existence  being an angel is often confused and unsure  n  city of angels  is essentially a love story  between seth and a human  a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie  meg ryan   nhe first sees her when he is in her operating room  waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven  nmaggie is distraught  doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table  and seth is moved by her efforts and  more importantly  her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies  nangels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain  and seth does what he can with his invisible touch  but its not enough  nhe wants to be with her and share her pain  not just stand back at a distance  nhe learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to  fall  and become human  nhe learns this from another fallen angel  played by dennis franz   n  y  p  d  nblue   in a touching and humorous performance  nsitting at a diner together  franz tells cages character about how wonderful it is to be human  to be able to taste food  feel another persons skin  smell the air  and most importantly  have a loving wife and children  nof course  there is pain to go along with all this  but for seth  it will be worth it  n  city of angels  is something of a reinterpretation of wim wenders haunting  film  wings of desire   nwenders film was more like a poem  it was the feeling  the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened  nthe americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles  and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human  nand  unlike most foreign films that are remade into hollywood fare  it doesnt suffer extensive damage  nthis may be because director brad silberling   casper   and screenwriter dana stevens   blink   wanted to make  city of angels  its own movie  inspired by  wings of desire   but not an attempt to copy it  nand yet   city of angels  is not a typical hollywood movie  nit is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale   the english patient    whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world  nseale creates many striking visuals  in addition to the beach scene  there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around  looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by  nwhile the film travels along a charted plot  it takes time to develop its characters and situations  it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly  and shows just how thin those boundaries are  nboth cage and ryan give soulful  softspoken performances  nryan  who is usually so bouncy and energetic  truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch  ncage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple  heartfelt gazes  and speaks with the comforting  knowing voice that only an angel could have  nwhat is most striking about  city of angels  is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay  which is both unexpected and challenging  nits not a formulaic hollywood ending  because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time  nit doesnt give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance  ninstead  it offers something much better  something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive  n___________ visit \" charlie don\\'t surf ! \" \\nan eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick http : //www . bigfoot .

      "bcapsule  the much anticipated readaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting  but very little intelligence  nvisually there is much to like about this version  but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gullivers travels and treat it as an action film  nthat makes it a film without much center  n     to   npierre boulle  author of the bridge on the river kwai  wrote planet of the apes  a  k  a  monkey planet   the novel  as a social satire  nit reads a lot like a fifth book of gullivers travels  nhumans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed  not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swifts island of the houyhnhnms  nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet  nit seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals  but perhaps i was just looking for that  nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in   he added a number of serling touches  familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serlingish  nthe final irony of the original version has become film history  nwithout it there could never have been a  planet of the apes  film series  ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language  nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language  nthat could have been done in the film  but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the nonapespeaking  nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and  of course  there is some justification for that by the end of the film  njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending  nbut serling never tackles the allimportant question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language  a language they had no opportunity to ever hear  nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole  however  and the film has become well respected in cinema history  npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmiths best if not his best  nwhen the films success called for sequels  the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added wellintentioned  though not very subtle  political messages about what was happening in the united states of the s and s  nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half hearted  by the second film  beneath the planet of the apes  there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases  nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in   nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again  nfor those who thought that the  version was not very faithful to the book  burtons new version is even less faithful  nfirst  he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes  nhe has them both be intelligent  articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands  uh  make that paws  of the apes  nthat could be a good story too  but it is not planet of the apes  nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century  the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring  nin  leo davidson  mark wahlberg  not this worlds most expressive actor  works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes  nthen a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizardofozfashion and drops him on an alien planet  n  yes  he survives this storm  but then no storm is perfect   nhe quickly finds  not greatly to any surprise he shows  that on this planet apes rule and humans drool  but everybody talks  nand the language they talk is earth english  napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that  nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didnt occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film  nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english  nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at humananimal relationships and more one of the masterslave relationships  noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic  nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari  played by helena bonham carter  nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power  nshe is bent on making the world a better place  nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hilari  nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout  carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film  nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward  nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes  nthis is a further abandonment of the source material  nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of eachs place in this reversed society  each important in the book  nwe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down  nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them  nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn  nthis is a miscalculation  as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in  nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win  nthe  script had little subtlety  with lines like  i never met an ape i didnt like   but at least we cared for what happened to taylor  the main character  nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals  nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog  nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup  nin general it seems much improved from   nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers  who did it for the  version  nin  chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper . \\nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion . \\nchambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker . \\ntoday audiences have higher expectations ; baker\\'s visualization is really an improvement . \\nthese visuals work nicely . \\nwhat does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make . \\nthey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon . \\napes spring incredible distances . \\nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost . \\none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up . \\nsince the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up . \\nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti . \\nit is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes . \\nbut he delivers them very well . \\nhe was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom . \\nas the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well . \\nin doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen . \\nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov\\'s performance in spartacus . \\nas an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself . \\ndanny elfman\\'s score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith\\'s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic . \\nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten . \\ni rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n'\n"

      "bladies and gentlemen  s independence day is here  nits title  starship troopers  nand surprisingly  it is more entertaining than id  ni realize that i gave last years scifi hit a  star rating  but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour  nafter subsequent viewings  i feel that independence day really wasnt as great as it seemedthough i still give it a positive review  nstarship troopers  on the other hand  has a mocking sense of humor  knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem  nas a result  starship troopers is a more exciting  energetic  and lively science fiction film  nin fact  i probably could never get tired of watching this film  nstarship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars  another kickass space opera which reinvented the scifi drama altogether  nwhile starship troopers is no star wars  it comes quite close  and the easiest assessment would be to call this film   the star wars of the s   nam i being to generous to this film  nperhaps  but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance  effectively  into the warring races  nin essence  this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction  nthe easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films  and i may have to  nstarship troopers is not quite an original film persay  but director paul verhoeven gives the film a  kickthealiensasses  style  nid had this same style  except it was forced  most likely the cause of will smith having a major role  nthis new  star wars  has a very simple  basic plot  mankind vs  an alien species  nthe alien species in question here is the bugs  a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnidtype insects  nhowever  the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy  nsometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes  but during quiet moments  we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization  nmore than likely  these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends  nand they should be  ni doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thoughtprovoking film  nthis is an  event  film  but surprisingly above average  nit is extremely refreshing to watch a scifi war film  and actually root for the human side  something independence day never achieved   nstarship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange  join the army  ads  nmixing a webbased interface  these summations of events are refreshingly original  nstating   would you like to know more    nthese short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor  and we know we should not take it seriously  nhowever  we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle  in a gory  yet funny  way  nafter witnessing the slaughter  the film jumps back one year  to setup what we just saw  nwe are introduced to johnny rico  casper van dien  and carmen ibanez  denise richards   nrico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms  nhowever  carmen isnt as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot  nhowever  another classmate  dizzy flores  dina meyer   has her eye on rico  nunfortunately  rico isnt interested in dizzy  nthis setup is rather cliched  as is the result of the setup  but it still is fun to watch  ncarmen signs up to become a starship trooper  and as a result  rico signs up  nand as a result  dizzy signs up  neveryone is assigned a certain position in the academy  carmen gets the pilot position she wanted  carl jenkins  neil patrick harris   a psychic  gets a position in the training program  and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers  the mobile infantry  nthe main story follows rico through his trials and relationships  nin reality  i found myself watching a space version of  melrose place   but with better special effects  nan hour into the film  the war begins  na sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with  nthe first hour may have been a funny  sometimes unintentionally  setup  but we grew to care for the flat characters  because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters  their gorgeous looks won me over  call me superficial  if you must   nfollowing the training sessions  which had many dramas in themselves  too many to mention here   the troopers are sent to war  nthe bugs live on the planet klendathu  a planet which consists of dirt and rock  and pretty much nothing else  nmany dramas occur during the war  until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs attacks  na sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense  nthe troopers are ordered to locate the  brain  and capture it  ni hopefully left the plot as vague as possible  because starship troopers is not about plot  nits about special effects and gory violence  ndirector verhoeven  most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct  returns to his scifi days  which gave us good films like total recall  \\nverhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . \\nstarship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year\\'s event horizon . \\nthe r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it . \\nmy guess is that verhoeven\\'s target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . \\nthe film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . \\ndespite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . \\nwhile watching the film , we never second guess the character\\'s decisions because they seem perfectly clear . \\nthankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . \\nthe cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you . \\ncasper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . \\nto most guys , he will come across as artificial . \\nfortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character . \\ndina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character . \\nher dizzy is extremely likeable . \\ndenise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done . \\njake busey , gary busey\\'s son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film . \\nneil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . \\nhowever , he does give a good performance . \\nmichael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm . \\nhis performance rises above the rest . \\nperhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside\\'s presence on screen . \\nunfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars . \\ndirector verhoeven is the main star of the film . \\nhis direction is fast and unrelentless . \\nhe never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride . \\nwriter edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . \\nthe writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny . \\nthe dialogue is smart but not too smart . \\nwe aren\\'t required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . \\nthankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don\\'t ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) . \\namazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . \\nin fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . \\nthe moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . \\ni haven\\'t laughed this loud , even in some comedies . \\noh , and the special effects are first rate . \\nstarship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . \\nbelieve me when i say this : don\\'t take young kids to see this film . \\nit is extremely violent . \\nin fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . \\nhowever , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain . \\nit\\'s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys . \\nand still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the

      "bim an avid fan of the  alien  saga  so this review is obviously a tad biased  at least i admitted it   nof course  that doesnt mean that im gonna be giving this a fourstar review or something  because  alien  resurrection   the fourth film in the coolashell series is not an absolutely amazing film  much like the first two were  nhowever  its a very good film which never fails to entertain  and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series  nin short  i had a good time  n  alien  resurrection  leaves off  years after the last one  where our heroine protagonist  ellen ripley  sigourney weaver   the science fiction genres answer to job  had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body  waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one  nof course  the last one wasnt very great or anything  i liked it  though not as much as the first two   and more importantly  it wasnt financially successful  a tawdry  million bucks    nso back we are  with ripley back as a clone  which means we get another little satirical look at cloning  not that thats a bad thing  but its becoming a cliche   nso shes cloned aboard an even more futuristiclooking ship called  the auriga  by some doctors  including the necessary bad government guy  dr  wren  played by j  e  freeman  as well as the littleseen dr  gediman  played by none other than brad douriff   mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her  nonce you get past the fact that you cant figure out where they got her blood  although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one   the films okay  nalso on board are a band of mercenary pirates  including michael wincott  ron perlman  kim flowers  raymond cruz  dominique pinon  a jeunet sytable  and    winona ryder  who plays analee call  who turns out to have a bit of a secret  i wont state it  but unless youve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years  you probably know all about it  although its nicely covered up   ntheres a bit of a nonsexualyetslightlyhomoerotic relationship between her and ripley  but its never really deepened enough  noh well  nwell  as you might have guessed  the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship  nand it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship  including some shocks  dan hedaya  for instance  whos death is comical yet sad since  well  hes dan hedaya   and the remaining people  about  or   are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth  nof course  the plot is all balderdash  and just an excuse for some good old  alien  brand fun  nthe real focus of the series seems to be on style  not really substance  although theres always a bit of it  most notably in  aliens  with the relationship between ripley and the little girl   nwhats interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach  n  alien  is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights  n  aliens  is a wild  tense thriller  n  alien   is a bleak  moody piece of seminoir  n  alien   is kind of like an offbeat french film  filled with lots of humor  and cool scares  njeanpierre jeunet  without his usual directing partner  marc caro  creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like  das boot  has  with echoes hinting at a possible threat  nthe chills in the film are really cool  especially with the music  which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes  theres the most tense surgery scene since  faceoff  towards the beginning   nand not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that  nthis all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others  nthere are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed  none is the aforementioned surgery scene  nanother one takes place between call and ripley  which is just awesome  nthe underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense  thrilling  and jawdropping scenes in the entire saga  with a small allusion to jeunets earlier film   delicatessen    nand the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool  with a lovely allusion to  goldfinger \" ) . \\nbut the best scene in the entire film ( i\\'m sure i\\'m not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an \" 8 \" tatooed on her arm ) . \\nit might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga . \\nthe screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters . \\nhowever , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there\\'s very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared . \\nand , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : \" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! \" \\njohner : \" well , i can get you off . \\nbut not this ship . \" ) \\nthe acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in \" se7en \" who performed the \" lust \" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him . \\nwinona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) . \\nof course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show . \\nplaying a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable . \\nshe\\'s not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for \" aliens , \" but she\\'s just awesome . \\noverall , it\\'s a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn\\'t really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment . \\nthe style is the best part of the film , which isn\\'t really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . \\nbut it\\'s entertaining as hell , and it\\'s definitely fit for the \" alien \" series . \\n'\n"

      "bset in the late s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis  who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie  less than zero   american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie  genre  that ellis helped to create  nchristian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman  a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc  e and his colleagues  nit seems that bateman is a serial killer and  unfortunately for his contemporaries  his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip  nas he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering coworkers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies  his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel  ni was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school  ni read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it  nas usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out  but i soon forgot about the novel and didnt end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore  ni picked it up and read it  but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers  nthe movie has a similar effect  but at least its less cryptic than ellis novel  nfor once  a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on  nboth the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations  down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses  but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout  nthe movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in batemans impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does  nas a result  the film is immensely more entertaining  nlions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films  having picked up kevin smiths catholicrattling dogma  and here with american psycho there is no difference  nscreenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it  nsome cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc  mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women  and initial reports said the film was unwatchable  nthankfully  it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park  bigger  longer  uncut  nside note   cowriter guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an illfated acquaintance of batemans who  after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute  proclaims that shes not a lesbian nor has any interest in it  nthe ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner  the writerdirector of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy  is a lesbian  nits a subtle injoke and its one i found to be pretty humorous  ndespite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young upandcomers  including reese witherspoon   most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos  nthe real draw here is christian bale and his overthetop performance as patrick bateman  nwhenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters  ni always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman  but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being  nto say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that hes as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger  none sequence in particular  involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news song  hip to be square  right before burying an axe in a coworkers head  features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film  nside note   despite the fact that huey lewis  hip to be square  and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film  dont expect to see them on the soundtrack release  nhuey lewis expressly requested that his song  featured in a rather large set piece in the film  much akin to the use of  stuck in the middle with you  in reservoir dogs   not be included on any soundtrack release  nim assuming that collins requested the same  non a similar note  whitney houstons cover of  the greatest love of all  is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isnt the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source  napparently  houston wasnt as open about the use of her song as the others were  na bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the films release  that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film  ndont look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more  nseveral web sites have been dedicated to the subject but im still undecided  nthere is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops  old ladies  and cleaning staff with equal gusto  nthe scene seemed very dreamlike and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying  as an example  bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car   ni kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there  but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence  though comic  throws the film offbalance  which i suppose was the intention   nother than the few flaws i have mentioned  american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film  although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in batemans reality   ni think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such  nit may not change anyones life  but it will certainly have an effect  ni know i will certainly hear  hip to be square  in a different context the next time i hear it  nr n\n"

let me clarify  i dont love just any cop movie  im not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the s and now slowly  gulp  returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker  nim partial to those gritty  earthy cop dramas like serpico  donnie brasco  and the french connection  nproblem is these films come along just about as often as george w  bush makes a cogent point so whenever a  true  cop movie does hit multiplexes  i come running towards it like an eager puppy    and inevitably i leave  head bowed  tripping over my squiggly tail  nso what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out    for a movie called one tough cop  which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spinoff  no    ntruth is im a sucker for those barren streets  that gritty  graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops  like modern day knights  must shield us from their iniquitous clutches  nyes its all very corny and awfully boys clubish  which  im guessing  is precisely where these feelings come from  nas little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joes  enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies  etc  the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies  and heighten them  turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos  nas an adult my tastes havent changed all that drastically  sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film  but i still delight at the promise a  guy  film could potentially bring  nnow what if its the cops whore the corrupt ones  nooh that one really gets me going  these protectors using all that at their service  taking advantage of others for their own gain  nthrow a courtroom drama  yech   ninto the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city  nhow absorbing is prince of the city  you ask  nso damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama  a subgenre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar  i remained completely and utterly involved  nthe film stars treat williams  who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at  nsince i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city  i cannot provide an answer as to why it didnt  n  though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves   nlike mickey rourke and eric roberts  both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory  williams is a talented leading man who didnt make it to where he should have  n  if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell   nhere  the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacinos in serpico  also directed by lumet   nwilliams plays danny ciello  a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty prejuliani streets of new york  nthey work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes  nand that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done  nthe squad relies entirely on informants  low level junkies  to gain access to the big wigs  and in order to obtain the info they seek  they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice  ndanny has done this  and though hes a fairly honorable guy  who took the job in order to do good  his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way  nhe seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a  double agent   nhe does so with one condition  he will not rat on his partners  nright away we know that that is exactly what hell have to do  nand watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be  nundercover cop films are almost innately exciting  even the kind that pull out all the cliches  like in too deep   nhow can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal  ambiguity  and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position  nprince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive  hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet  as well as a handful of intense performances  most notably by treat  nlumets greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back  and lets the camera soak up the action  nhis scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension  and he rarely holds for reaction shots  instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking  nlumets worst tendency is one that many film makers  especially oliver stone  tend to overuse  he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension  nthis isnt as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan  lumets most recent cop  lawyer endeavor  a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching  nthough of late lumet has made several really awful career choices  maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something   the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria  here he was on  sustaining tension in a film that runs for  minutes with not one dull spot  nsome of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic  nhollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable  nof course cop movies arent popular anymore  yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines   but just look at the average hollywood action movies  flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isnt gay  the lame comic relief

      "bnote  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  nbe forewarned  nat the end of the day  those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros  made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere  nthis highlyanticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening  where it would have gone headtohead against the rival studios heavy hitters  its eventual demotion to a less potent midaugust opening was an obvious early indication of the studios lack of confidence with the picture  nand with good reason  nthis is a joyless exercise of a film  held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement  thrills or wit  nremarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving  the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last years case study in style over substance  joel schumachers muchloathed batman  robin  n  indeed  both films even feature appalling  ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes   numa thurman  who takes on the salacious role of the catsuitclad  karatechopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg  was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster  imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage  nunfortunately  the same cant be said here  where she and cohort ralph fiennes  our new john steed  taking over for patrick macnee  demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever  fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade doubleentendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that theyre on board a sinking ship  nat this rate  usuallysplendid actor mr  fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man  his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettablyneglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days  nthe duo  look  the part  and admittedly the avengers is  more than most  heavily dependent upon style  but theyre no fun to watch  and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the pictures caperesque plot  nwhen not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat  i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs  peel  no  not kate beckinsale  although the notion now intrigues me   but gwyneth paltrow  who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spoton english accent  nif nothing else  itd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt  nthe story  such as it is  involves the everbemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter  sean connery   an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climatecontrolling contraption  n  they also sip a lot of tea   noverlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists superiors  it sounds far better than it plays  and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant postproduction tinkering  its clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds  nthe avengers was never about gripping drama  and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously  but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac  its all decidedly uncompelling  nmr  connery  whos onscreen barely long enough to register an impression  approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation  simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest  nat least it all looks good  nthis is a genuinely handsome production  with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt  nin particular  the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention  adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain  nthere are a handful of striking visual moments in the film  including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water  but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates  nby the time the films climax had arrived  my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain  but with the quickest escape route from the theatre  nnot coincidentally  the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movies remarkable trailer  a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself  the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year  nits everything that the avengers is not  saucy  clever  engaging  and entertaining  na crushing disappointment  the film is one of the worst outings of the year  too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad  too polished to overlook its deficiencies  nthere may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers  but i sure hope not  n\n",

dodge mr  woodman  ever wary of his wifes tuna casserole  n  so   you ask   where is he now   nmr  kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional highstakes poker  nthats right  nim not sure if its his main source of income  but from what ive heard  the guy occasionally comes away with    at a time  nand there you were  thinking i was going to tell you he was doing offbroadway theater  nyou silly goose  nwell  gabe kaplan isnt in the movie rounders  nor is the film about the actor come gamblers life  nbut rounders is about poker  and gabe plays poker  and i thought that was kind of a neat connection  nsorry about the segue  or lack thereof  nmatt damon plays mike mcdermott  a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker  nhes been playing for a while  and more than being proficient  he has caught the bug  nhe goes to all the underground games in new york city  knows the regulars  and knows how to win  nin the beginning of the film  hes built up a nice thirty grand nest egg  which he takes to the speakeasytype gaming parlor where the big boys play  nmike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb  john malkovich   an oreomunching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia  nmike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker  but instead he loses it all in a single hand  nmonths later  hes paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck  nwhen mikes best friend and poker buddy worm  edward norton  finishes his jail term for hustling some students  he wants to pick up right were they left off  working as a team to part others with their betting cash  nalthough mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student  jo  gretchen mol   worm connives mike into playing once more  and mike  bitten again by the bug  slides down that slippery slope  risking his relationship  education  and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life  nto make a film about gambling  a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters  nthis is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth  nrounders  however  seems to go more for the latter than the former  nthe card clubs mike and worm frequent arent very glamorous at all  ntheres a basement  a lodge with elk heads on the wall  a goulash joint  these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots  nexcept for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city  the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table  nthe reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it  nwere given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations  and good actors to play them  nmatt damon is very natural as mike  who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school  and answering what may be his true calling  playing professional poker  ned nortons worm is truly a worm  always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what theyre worth  njohn turturro  who amazes me with his acting range  tones it down in this film by playing joey knish  a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments  nhes both a friend and mentor to mike  and turturros lowkey performance is totally convincing  just as john malkovichs heavilyaccented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself  nmartin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mikes law professors  abe petrovsky  nwhile landau slips well into the role  his character  spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to ones self  facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending  nperhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable lineup of acting talent  however  is gretchen mol who just didnt seem to have much presence on screen  nshes a genuine peach to look at  kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel  and i wouldnt be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blondhaired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world   but her delivered lines seemed very flat  and i found myself looking for matt damons reactions instead  na good thing about rounders is that it doesnt get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it cant find time for humor  nthe film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going  such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next  in widely different locales  none game in a cigar club had me in stitches  n  i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper   says one of the players  clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other  ni was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys  nwith all the poker being played  rounders had the potential to be very confusing  nyou might think you know a lot about poker  but think again  nluckily  were given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain whats going on  nthe narrations are more informative than intrusive  and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do  nits nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world . \\nas a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades . \\nwait ! \\nas a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace . \\nhang

      "bi know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard  nthe problem is  i cant remember them as i write this review  nthats not a good sign  nin booty call  jamie foxx is bunz  a character whom i cant really describe  because i dont know that much about him  ni only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk  and that he doesnt like relationships  just  booty calls  at three in the morning  no questions  no commitment   nbunz has a best friend named rushon  tommy davidson   who seems to be bunzs direct opposite  on the straight and narrow  and currently in a longterm commitment  a whole seven weeks  wow    nrushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend  nikki  tamala jones   but for a reason which is not totally explained  its going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikkis friend lysterine  vivica a  fox   who have never met  nto make a long story short  the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikkis obsession with safe sex  nfirst she wants condoms  so bunz and rushon go out and get them  noh  no  they have to be latex  not lambskin  nback to the store  nnow theyve got to get dental dams  or therell be no foreplay  nwhy are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand  nnikki phones lysterine  who lives across the hall  and tells her shed better be making these demands  too  ntalk about coitus interruptus  nbooty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those overthetop comedies  nthe difference between the two is that in the latter  things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality  nin this category  for example  you have ace ventura  private eye on the mild side  and airplane  nat the extreme  nthere are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status  but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention  nit is disappointing  and even worse  distracting  nthere are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker  are those real names   ndoes not live up to its potential  as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing  nfor instance  there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant  nbunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese  much to everyones surprise  nhowever  when asked how he learned the language  he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from latenight kungfu films  and soon gained mastery  nthis negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene  nif  on the other hand  when asked how he learned to speak chinese  bunz simply replied with   kungfu movies   and then moved on  the joke would have been much more effective  nthis is because it would have been totally unbelievable  but funny because we know it is unbelievable  nby explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible  the film is not giving its viewers enough credit  nthe inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions  nwhy are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends  nwhy do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine  nif nikki is so obsessed with safe sex  why doesnt she have some condoms at her own apartment  nthese questions are not answered by the screenplay  but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward  na very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language  nsome movies use a lot of swear words  but use them under very justifiable circumstances  as when they are employed consistent with a characters pattern of speech  nother films  such as the recent jackie brown  use them in ways that almost parody themselves  nbooty call just sticks them in to get laughs  and it doesnt work  nthey stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them  nhalf of the scenes seem to occur for no reason  nthe chinese restaurant  a holdup at a convenience store  and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story  and are in there for filler  nthis is surprising  considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long  nits too bad that the core of the film isnt much better  since it is comprised of sometimes funny  but forgettable dialog  ni refer you to the first paragraph of this review  n\n",

      "b  mercury rising  has numerous flaws  but there is one that really stands out  its central plot device is unnecessary  nthats right  nthe major aspect of the film  that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy  action flicks could be dropped from the beginning  and the movie would turn out exactly the same  if not better  nthis central device is the fact that a nineyearold boy is autistic  nhis name is simon  and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow  alec baldwin  wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it  nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film  and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent  unfair world against his will  with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him  nthe fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of  mercury rising   ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simons character and his relationship with willis  but here it is lost  nmiko hughes  the young actor who plays simon  goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic  he walks slowly  drawls his words  kicks and screams when hes touched  and has a hard time looking at other people  nits a difficult role for an adult  much less a young child  to play  and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isnt playing like hes autistic  nunlike dustin hoffmans performance in  rain man  or leonardo dicaprios in  whats eating gilbert grape   we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting  nhowever  unlike  rain man  which used its characters autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story   mercury rising  could go right about its generic  predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid  nhell  he doesnt even have to be shy  nin fact  the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role  rather than just being carted around under willis arm  nwillis character  art jeffries  is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything  nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simons house  where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide  nof course  we know that isnt the way it happened happen because we saw an evil  squarejawed government hitman with a meanlooking crewcut knock off the parents  nsimon was able to get away  and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet  which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked  njeffries  who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it  knows there is something more  and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon  nthis is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simons parents is crawling everywhere  attempting to kill simon at the hospital  on the highway  and every other place he goes  nlate in the movie  jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey  kim dickens  who he meets at a coffee shop  nof all the hardtobelieve aspects of the movie  this is the worst  ni can believe in the decency of the human heart  but staceys character is far too accommodating  nnot only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery  she lets him into her apartment at two oclock in the morning when she knows the police is after him  and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent  nthe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point  nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences  but even here  mercury rising  doesnt rise to the challenge  nthe movie was directed by harold becker  who has made some good suspense films including  sea of love     and  malice      but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion  nthere is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman  played by peter stormare  that is so ineptly directed  shot and edited  that i had no idea   exactly where they were on the streetcar    who was hitting who  and   where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were  nthe grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building  and features a harrowing  yawn  scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building  not because he has to  but because its more suspenseful that way  ntaken as a whole   mercury rising  is an tepid  confused movie that lacks style  wit  and any traces of a sense of humor  nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles  but here he is too

      "bin the interest of being generous  i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black  nsir anthony hopkins  playing a superrich media mogul  has gathered his family around him for dinner  nhis oldest daughter  played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing   who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party  presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes  which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake  nthe daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes  nhopkins  frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair  does what any man in his position would do  he punts  nwhichever one you like  dear  he says  nand the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do  she cries  ni liked that scene for two reasons  nfirst  the cakes looked really cool  nsecond  it was  perhaps  the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act  nmeet joe black is chockfull of odd performances  people doing things for no discernible reason at all  and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot  nits easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani  but its even easier to sleep right through it  two people on my row managed it quite nicely   nthe difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess  ni know my audience had problems with the movie  because they thought it was a comedy  ncase in point  everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie  nhowever  the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani  n  its not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death  but it makes a certain kind of sense   nit shouldnt take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr  pitt  nand indeed they do  after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt   because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished  nwell  when that happened  the audience howled with laughter  and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous  nso  if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawingroom humor are funny  i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately  nanyway  the deceased lawyers body  no worse the wear from its massive injuries  is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role  nthe idea is that death  given the pen name of joe black  so as not to disturb others  wants to take a holiday and experience the world  nif this werent hollywood  we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death  but since it is  we get scene after scene of fishoutofwater humor  just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck whos wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesnt know how to act in our society  nit also doesnt help that the character of death is written so inconsistently  nhe claims to be on vacation  but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani  just try to get your travel agent to book that one   nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois  nhe knows everything about some characters  nothing about others  nand as played by brad pitt  hes not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing  hes just there  nits as if someone told pitt   never mind about acting in this picture  son  just stand there and look pretty   nits as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie  nive used the phrase  angel of death  in this review very deliberately to contrast pitts performance with this years best angel performance  nicolas cages in city of angels  nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling  cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows  nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man  pitt is aloof and arrogant  ncage struck instant chemical sparks with costar meg ryan  where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlanis character is so shallow that she cant see beyond pitts good looks  nthe movies other top name is a much better actor  but that doesnt save meet joe black  nsir anthony hopkins isnt given much better material to work with  unfortunately  nhe plays one of these goodhearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood  n  one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkinss character more realistically evil   nhopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker  but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world  nof course  no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder  nbut i have to wonder  and in this movie  you have a very long time to wonder  how you or i would act in a similar situation  especially if you or i were a multimillionaire  nhopkins pretty much goes to the office  and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation  nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated  im sure  ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black  and im asking myself why  nmovies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest  which is what im going to do now  ngo spend time with your family  go volunteer for a local charity  heck  go take a nap  ndont go see meet joe black  because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death  n curtis edmonds n  no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to

runs a private investigation firm in new york city  nhowever  the focus of the film lies on his samenamed nephew  samuel l  jackson   who  as the film begins  is a cop whose takenocrap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors  nwhen a privileged young man named walter wade jr   christian bale  accused of a brutal  raciallymotivated murder is allowed to be released on bail  a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p  i  nbut thats easier said than done  for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez  jeffrey wright   a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri  toni collette   the only eyewitness to his crime  npeoplesor  rather  wright is also the big obstacle in jacksons way toward commanding this film  npeoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time  and wright is insanely funny during these stages  nhowever  he isnt so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish  and peoples eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable  which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo  who bowed out before filming   nits no easy task to steal a film from the jackson  who is his usual captivating  charismatic self here   but thats exactly what wright doesand makes it seem effortless  nthen again  with such a talented ensemble surrounding him  it is not too surprising that jacksons impressive star turn doesnt quite tower over the rest  he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other costars  nbale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in americanpsycho  so it only follows that his performance as a similar  less exaggerated character would be spoton  ncollette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened  conflicted diane  nbusta rhymes brings some good laughs as shafts sidekick rasaan  nregistering not as stronglybut through no fault of their ownare vanessa williams  as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez  and a dismayingly underused roundtree  they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price  singleton  and shane salerno  n  jackson also has little to  do  in a sense  some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside  his shaft doesnt even have one sex scene   nthat singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since hes not really an action director  nthis is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases  nthey move well  as does the film as a whole  and are reasonably exciting  its just that theres nothing terribly inventive about them  nthese set pieces are functional in the way the script is  they work well enough  but theyre unsurprising and conventional  nbut if theres anything that a shaft movie does well  its make the familiar look cooland this shaft keeps that tradition alive  nfrom the slick title sequencescored  of course , to isaac hayes\\' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . \\neven a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . \\nstyle doesn\\'t exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that\\'s of little consequence . \\nwhat matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth . \\n'\n"

      "bfritz langs first american film since leaving nazi germany  is an eyeopener about a lynch mob in a small town  njoe wilson  spencer tracy  is a regular joe  a hardworking stiff  a decent guy  who is living with his two brothers  tom  walcott  and charlie  albertson   in chicago  nhe is engaged to katherine grant  sylvia sidney   but cant save up enough money to marry her  nshe takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher  nbefore she departs  she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother  sews up his ripped trench coat  corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento  and kisses him goodbye  na year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city  that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station  ndriving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her  he arrives at a nearby town called strand  nbut the deputy sheriff  buggs  meyers  walter brennan  comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him  nhe accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl  nthe sheriff  ellis  finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket  he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money  and he fits the general description of the suspect  nlocked in jail  he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence  nin the local bar  the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping  nfueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect  a mob storms the jail  burns it down and dynamites it when they cant get through to the prisoners jail cell  nthe sheriff called the governor for the national guard  but one of his political advisers countermanded that request  saying it wouldnt look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him  nsomehow joe escapes  but his dog rainbow dies  nkatherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell  and becomes convinced that he died  nthe next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses  njoe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers  who are startled to see him alive  that he wants revenge  nhe thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the  leaders in the lynch mob  nan ambitious district attorney  walter abel  prosecutes the  for murder  nkatherine  not knowing hes alive  remains in a state of shock  but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death  nthe defense claims that it cant be a charge of murder without a corpse  nthe trial proves to be interesting  as the citizens in this closeknit  respectable community  lie under oath  providing alibis for each other to prove they couldnt have been at the jail  nthe sheriff also lies  saying he cant identify anyone in the mob  nbut proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film  nas for proof of the corpse  an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe  nin the note  memento is misspelled  which makes katherine realize that joe is alive  nwhen the sentence is announced   of the accused are found guilty of murder  but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened  nkatherine forgives him  and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have  nbut dont blame lang for all the changes in the film  of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive  nmgm couldnt bear to have it made the way lang wanted it  that is  by having tracy die in the lynching  ninstead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur  and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script  nto langs credit  even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference  it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook  nhis portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised  nyou couldnt help get the feeling that the citizens didnt care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man  but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their  vigilantes from going to jail  even perjuring themselves  ntheir reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they werent going to be convicted  nlang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident  nhe does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed  and the innocent  jovial goodguy  seen in the beginning of the film  has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience  n\n",
      "b     because im a scientist  nthats what we do   n dr  alexander mccabe  bob gunton   in response to why he created evil bats  nalright folks  stop me if youve heard this one  genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals  assisted by a specialist in the particular animals field  must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth  noh yeah  the military is on their way to bomb the town as well  so they are running short on time  nsound familiar  nsuch is the plot of the destination films release of bats  ndina meyer stars as the  bat specialist  sheila  who is pulled from her research  along with her annoying sidekick  played with irritating deftness by leon  in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently  nwith the help of the local sheriff  lou diamond phillips   a cdc official  carlos jacott   and a scientist  bob gunton   sheila discovers it is indeed bats  who have been genetically altered by guntons character to be more aggressive and omnivorous  in order to be used as a military weapon    ni have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film  ntheres not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good  nin this respect  the film never disappointed me  nthis film reaches a level that transcends the  so bad its good  level and borders on the downright insane  nthe effects are awful  the script is contrived  and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously  i think   ni challenge anyone to sit through the scene  where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner  with a straight face  nthankfully  the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with  ndina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in  johnny mnemonic  dragonheart  and starship troopers    nthe latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit   and this one is no exception  nwhile one never really gets the impression that meyers character could be a bat expert in reality  one never really cares to doubt it either  nshe gives as good a performance as could be expected  plus shes nice to look at for an hour and a half  nlou diamond phillips is also serviceable here  as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero  nalthough when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for whats going on in town  for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats  nthe only bad performance in the film is that of leons  nhe is relegated to the  im not sticking around here   ncharacter and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays  nanyone who cant immediately tell that bob gunton  the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films  is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised  but i highly doubt it  neven if he hadnt been the villain in just about every film hes ever been in  so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever  nin fact  his death is welcome  because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale  nif the plot doesnt sound ridiculous to you yet  then check out these little tidbits  a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol  nan entire town disregards the sheriff and doctors orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated  causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force  killing several townsfolk  na government official blows off shelias instructions  to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats cave that will kill all of them off  by pulling a night job  resulting in the death of an entire military unit  na cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it  nfinally  to top it all off  this little texas town is showing nosferatu in its single screen theater  for reference  our town has over a million people in it with nearly  movie screens  and were lucky to even get kevin smiths dogma   nthe most laughable part of the movie though comes from the illconceived bat puppets  nwhile the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing  making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend whats going on   the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more lowkey  ntherefore we the audience get loving closeups of the most unrealistic  rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film  nbeing able to see the puppeteers arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse  nafter all of this  if you still decide bats might be the movie for you  dont say you havent been warned  ntrust me when i say that its a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through  ni just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in  nshes definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these

      "byou think that these people only exist in the movies  but trust me  theyre as real as life  ni once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual persons brain with microwaves  nthen i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections  ni even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted  nthese people had what are known as  conspiracy theories   ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public  na little imagination goes a long way  nin richard donners conspiracy theory  jerry fletcher  mel gibson  is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything  nhis latest  that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle  might sound outrageous to us  but is all in a days work for him  nhe combs the newspaper  looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goingson behind the scenes  and from there jerry draws his conclusions  nupstanding citizen that he is  he tries to convince alice sutton  julia roberts  of the justice department that the president must be warned  nlucky gal  alice  who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since  nwhat she doesnt know is that jerrys interest in her is far more than  well  professional  nhe goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment  nbut when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerrys ideas and his limitedcirculation  conspiracy theory  newsletter  he finds himself in danger and in real need of alices help  none of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an actionthriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action  nor a significant number of thrills  npart of this is a result of the films slow pace  nit takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice  and even once that is over with  the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement  nat over two hours  this film could have been significantly condensed and had its running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour  but even then  the action scenes would not be able to save the film  ninstead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces  were treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite  black elements   black helicopter  men in black action suits and body armor  black vehicles  you know the drill  nthey come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons  but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time  nbig deal  weve seen it all before  nwatching the film  i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination  but i was out of luck  nnow  when i say it took forever to set up the  relationship  between jerry and alice  i completely mean what one person is relative to the other  and not romantic involvement  noh  donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie  the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other  but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring  nyou see  there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies  also directed by donner  than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory  nthe two just dont click  and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether  like finding out hes been stalking her   the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced  nthe script in general also seems forced  like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it  then took it and forced it upon us  ndialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable  to the point that i almost stopped listening  neven gibsons usual gift for ad lib couldnt punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest  although one of jerrys theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing  nunfortunately  much of whats discussed in the film is not inherently important to whats going on  but instead filler that starts out with potential  but ends up just being extraneous because its never followed through  nfor example  jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station  nhe even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break  hence the water in a subway station   and that the coroner should check the mans lungs for chlorine  nthis is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him  nyou know what happens then  nnothing  zip  nada  nno followup whatsoever  so whats the significance  nokay  heres another one  na couple of well known  real life  assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j  d  salinger novel  the catcher in the rye   njerry also has a bunch of copies  nwhenever he goes into a bookstore  he has to buy one  nleaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin  were never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin  nnot when we find out about his salinger collection  not when he goes to the bookstore  not later on when we get the answer to our first question  nthe point becomes totally extraneous  noh  did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film  nyeah  he plays this government psychiatrist named dr  jonas who may or may not be a bad guy  nthats about it  nfor all the presence this usually marvelous actor has  hes nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory  nyou can just lump him in with the supporting players  with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi  nthis guy was really likable  and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time  nokay  heres my theory  nthis really started out as a great film  but some of its jokes were actually true  nthe government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security  and this was what was left over  n\n"

      "bsince most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what theyre portraying  its fitting to say that  beloved  come as a real shock as a film  nits confusing  bizarre  and as tough a film to watch as any film ive seen all year  and thats not necessarily because of the threehour running time  n  beloved  is challenging to watch  filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard  and instead of a straightforward  hollywoodized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed   beloved  comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened  or  rather  toni morrison  who wrote the novel upon which this is based   n  beloved  tells the story of an exslave named sethe  played by oprah winfrey  who lives on a large farm in the north with her children  nwhen the film opens  her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist  which shakes things up  wounds the dog  and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family  nsethe is proud  though  and will not move  nher sons run away  leaving only her and her daughter  denver  kimberly elise  alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation  na couple years pass  and the ghost remains  and one day  a man named paul d  danny glover   another exslave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together  arrives  asking for lodging  nhe has been wandering around since he left the plantation  and when he enters the house  it turns red and becomes incredibly hot  nwhen he remarks about what he thinks is evil  sethe replies  it aint evil  nits just sad   nsome more time passes  and paul d has become a fervent member of the household  and the ghost disappears  nbut when they return one day from going out  they discover a young woman sitting in the house  nher name is beloved  and as played by thandie newton  she has almost zero motor skills  nshe stumbles around  halfgrabbing onto things and knocking them over  and when she speaks  she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk  nthey let her into her house  and she begins to turn things upside down  n  beloved  acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story  nmost of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic  lowlit room  with the occasional flash to the past  where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modernday psychoanalysts  nsethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation  which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands  with her nipples being licked  prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it   they took my milk   nworst of all was the month after her freedom  when she was allowed to live like a free person  working with other blacks on a farm  and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back  nshe runs to the barn near by  carrying her four children  and when her old owners burst in  they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they dont leave them alone  nwhen she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film  she says she doesnt regret it  nshe killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did  and she has convinced herself she did the right thing  nof course  beloved is really her daugher materialized  though we arent flat out told that until later on in the film  nbeloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long  nthus   beloved  becomes a sortaredux of the andrei tarkofsky scifi classic   solaris   where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife  who commited suicide years before  has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system  nthat film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories  how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past  and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us  it would control us completely  n  beloved  moves along freely  without a lot of explanation  and for the most part  this is extremely respectable  nthe most interesting films are the ones that dont explain everything for us  leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense  nsethe is never fully explained as a character  but we understand all her actions since shes being played by oprah winfrey  nits been well over a decade since her last major performance in  the color purple   but judging from these two films  ill bet shes one of the best actresses working today    if nshe was strictly an actress  nher talk show  which i suppose is a great entity  has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress  and thats a shame because she brings so much to this movie  nemotion  nsadness  nstrength  nwatching the strong sethe  whos so afraid of the past that shes built a rather strong protective coating around herself  break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great  nshe makes it real  nthats not to say this is a perfect film  nin fact  id wager to say that the fact that its confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is  nwhile oprahs performance is powerful and easily sympathetic  and im dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february   the structure of the film  which doesnt show what happened to her children till halfway through the film  prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film  nit doesnt necessarily move as though theyre memories of one particular character  and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore . \\nbut despite its tediousness , perhaps that\\'s the point . \\nthe distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality . \\nand for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be . \\njonathan demme\\'s direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters . \\nthere\\'s more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism . \\nthe acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination . \\neveryone has been raving about thandie newton\\'s performance , and how it should be rewarded . \\nhowever , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part . \\nact like a baby . \\nthrow things . \\nstumble around . \\nchew food with your mouth open . \\ni do think there\\'s another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it\\'s kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother\\'s loss of reality towards the end . \\nit\\'s not that newton isn\\'t great : she\\'s as annoying and wacky as the role demands . \\nit\\'s just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better . \\ndespite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , \" beloved \" has still not done well . \\ncosting , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two . \\nunfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic \" caligula , \" the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) . \\nalthough i respect \" beloved , \" i can\\'t say that i really enjoyed it . \\n'\n",

      "btheres more to a quilt than fabric and threadeach patchwork design has its own unique story  or stories  to tell  nin how to make an american quilt  the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse  proof   we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality  nall the sorrows  joys  longings  sufferings  and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and  as their bittersweet memories are given expression  one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future  nmotion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals  how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative  nthe  quilting bee  consists of seven members  sisters gladys  ann bancroft  and hy  ellen burstyn   sophia  lois smith   a woman known for frightening children  emma  jean simmons   the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man  constance  kate nelligan   who has been having an affair with emmas husband  anna  maya angelou   the leader of the group  and marianna  alfre woodard   annas daughter  nthe project theyre busy with is the wedding quilt for hys granddaughter  finn  winona ryder   who has just become engaged  nshes spending the summer with hy and gladys  and away from her fiance  to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants  and whether its better to marry a friend or a lover  none of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast  nfrom winona ryder  ann bancroft  ellen burstyn  and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn  claire danes  and kate capshaw  this film is overflowing with realized talent  nthe performances are good enough  in fact  to cover up many of the scripts weaknesses  nhow to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable  if affecting  tale of love across the generationsa sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club  with a dash of fried green tomatoes added  nthere are probably too many characters  nso  instead of really getting to know a few of them  we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives  nwe learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy  and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible  nthere are other episodes as well  the love of annas life  mariannas soul mate  and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friends husband  nthe sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finns story  whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger  nthere is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt  nthe stories are all welltold  but its difficult to really connect with the characterstheir moments pass so quickly  nwhile we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals  our emotional investment is tenuous  nthere isnt enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way  and many of the personalities and relationships feel half formed  like a quilt with patches missing  nto put it bluntly  while i enjoyed watching this film  it didnt  do much  for me  non the whole  how to make an american quilt is a nicelyunderstated drama that has a lot to say about love  passion  and monogamy in relationships  nfinns segment is by far the most compelling  because shes the focal point  her actions are shaped by everyone elses experiences  nthe other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees  nif theres a disappointment here  its that the script doesnt have more resonance  but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional  n\n",
      "bwith the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink  the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories  quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the  film noir  genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control  fargo  millers crossing  blood simple   and offthewall comedies centered around an eccentric  scatterbrained lead character  raising arizona  the hudsucker proxy   ntheir latest offering  the big lebowski  falls within the latter category  though there are elements of the crimegonewrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film  nthe main difference  however  is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didnt quite have the brains to get it all together  the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy whos wise to the world  but he doesnt really want to do much of anything besides go bowling  smoke pot  and generally relax  nthat main character is jeffrey  the dude  lebowski  jeff bridges   introduced by the films rambling narrator  sam elliott  as  quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county   nthe dude is unemployed  needless to say  and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends  walter  john goodman   a borderlinepsychotic whos in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebodys cheating in a bowling match   has the whole world gone crazy    he shouts at a suspected cheater   and donny  steve buscemi   whos always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it   donny  you have no frame of reference here     nthese three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments  and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana  john turturro   who  when we first meet him  is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of  hotel california  and  if its possible  seems to be even more of a head case than walter  nif that doesnt give you a good idea of this films absurdist tone  then perhaps this will  the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dudes rug  ntheyve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the  big  lebowski  david huddleston  and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny  tara reid  owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn  ben gazzara   nthe dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug  he doesnt have any luck  but when bunny is apparently kidnapped  the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the  million ransom  nunfortunately  walter gets involved and fouls up the dropoff  and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers  the dudes car gets stolen  along with the briefcase containing the money  nsoon  the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german  nihilists  who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place  the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn  nmeanwhile  the big lebowskis daughter maude  julianne moore   a feminist avantgarde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked  wants to recover the money for her family  nthe plot  however  is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc  nthe previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revivals  run through the jungle   and it fits  the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases  with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble  usually unsuccessfully   nthe film doesnt feature quite as many oneliners and sight gags as the coens other comedies  though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor  particularly in the dudes dream sequences and acid flashbacks   but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact  nthe film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result  you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this  jungle  but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations  but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution  ntheres also a noticeable  but not too heavyhanded  thread of social commentary in the big lebowski  which  incidentally  takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin  at the beginning  we see george bush on television making his  this aggression will not stand  speech  nthe coens take aim at just about every elite l  a  subculture in the book  the egotistical wealthy businessman   the bums will always lose   nshouts the big lebowski at one point   the porn industry  the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their  peaceful beach community   and so on  nby the end  we really start to admire the dude  who almost certainly harbors the least  aggression  of anyone in this story  his passive resistance  emphasis on  passive   albeit  to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters  nhe also turns out to have a pretty wellfunctioning brain in his head  even if he doesnt like to use it very much  his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when hes getting a run around  and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end  nthe coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness  but they dont just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either  ni think that  more than anything  is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy  it manages to approach characters like the dude and  to some extent  walter  with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatterbrained  naudience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the undynamic duo by the end of the movie  given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first . \\n \" it\\'s good knowin\\' he\\'s out there , the dude , takin\\' it easy , \" posits the narrator towards the end . \\ni dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken . \\n'\n"

to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up  twohour long episode of magyuver  nand not a particularly good one at that  nwhat went wrong  nmi begins flashily enough  that initial flash leading us to believe that itll soon give way to something of a plot  but it only gives way to more flash  then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruises firing gun just so they can die really cool  nearly on  during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt  tom cruise  and nyah nordoffhall  thandie newton   woo works some of his trademark magic  nin one hypnotic  though completely inexplicable sequence  the director slows the action down to a

toppling over a neighboring cliff  nprior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain  sans scaffolding  then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another  nwhy  ni havent the foggiest  ni doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply  nwith mi woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine  the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects  nits possible that these  spies  could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off  though of course this is never explored  nthe scenes ive described are really only included to titillate  not to give any insight into character  ngod forbid  nwoo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic  but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commerciallike visuals  nstill in terms of crackerjack eye candy  the opening has much to cherish  ncruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices  the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage  romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is   nbetween the frantic dancing  woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact  nthe scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa  kind of way  yet it has style and something of soul  and woo casts a bit of a spell on us  nsure its all smoke and mirrors  but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product  nthandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene thats about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez  george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight  nthey flirt and exchange obvious double entendres  nnewton bats her eyes flirtatiously  ncruise grins a little too slyly  nthe cruise character  ethan hunt  has been drastically altered since the first film  nhere cruise plays him more as a hip  sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part   nhes cool and dashing  which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut  which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film   and blustered his way through magnolia  quite possibly the most overrated performance of the s   nsadly as the film progresses we see less of cruises initial  im the man   ncharm and more slomo closeups of his preening mug  nmi falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act  which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just wont stop  nthe whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle  the first gun fight in the film   which really should be unheard of in a john woo film  but alas this particular battle couldve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi  of course excepting the  symbolic  pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture   nweve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand  nit isnt done any differently here  nthe action is pure hard target  broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind  nhes cool for sure but hes made to be as empty as the movie  nthe actor isnt used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks  he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment  be it during a gunfight  before one or after one  nwhen hes not beaming away  hes staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell  but woos editing seriously undermines the effort  nhe fetishizes cruises angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof  ni half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that hes really austin powers  nin a classic woo action moment  ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pinup boy angel of death  nthe gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual  one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise  basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does   nthe lead bad guy  played by the appropriately british dougray scott  and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken    on motorcycles  nthough instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment  the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug  only to fly about a hundred feet  still in bear hug position   land on a beach below and begin a manoemano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a  so you thought i was dead      nnot to worry  cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat  nwhat a hero  nyou may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mis plot  \\nmy reasoning is simple : i\\'m not sure of any good it would do . \\nthe film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next \" special \" effect . \\ni wasn\\'t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video . \\nnobody will go to this for the plot , and if they do they\\'ll surely regret it . \\nas summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing . \\nin mi , the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma\\'s ( that film\\'s director ) stylistic flourishes , while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo\\'s non-stop masturbatory pandemonium . \\nit\\'s irrelevant in every sense , as is character . \\nall that ultimately matters are those

      "bi dont box with kid gloves  ni dont play nice  im not a nice guy  and i never  ever  go easy on a film  ni consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic  nhowever  i do some favors  and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery  nrigormortis  the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking  gets several of these points each time  ni still  however  will not go easy on them  nthey recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy  which begins  quite wittily  with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film   and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it  nin the famous lines of many martyrs  i have no regrets  nwell  i do have some regrets  but that is not the point in the previous sentence  nthe point of it was that down with america was a film that  from a critical standpoint  did not entirely disappoint me  nsure  the risky use of vhs instead of super mm or mm was a pain  and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films  but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable  ndown with america concerns a government agent  needless murder  and a book containing everything from the unabombers manifesto to the  apple computer profit report  nlike the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed  it displays an offkilter humor and intelligence  it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail  nthe best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the s  na dying movement from the day they started  these paranoid thrillers had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word  roswell   nin down with america  the line roswell is highly absent  nwith an about ten minute running time  down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich  that the conspiracy films fell into  makes jokes at them at the same time  and provides us with funny and memorable characters  nagain  i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldnt care less about  nthe film  as previously stated  concerns a federal agent  peter roach   an obsessed librarian  meri stevens   a mystery man  joe kaczkowski   and two people obsessed with silence in the library  robb sherman  kevin flowers   nthe plot  a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in  a public library where it can be viewed by all  nfrom there we go into a delightful parody  nthe federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth  the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books  nwe spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast  nalthough the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to noname  it ends up being the noname people who do a good job  delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out  nfor once  i dont have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online  ni can only say that you should find my previous reviews of lauto and les xfiles and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself  nits almost as much fun as the film  n\n",
      "bbob the happy bastards quickie review  ni must admit  no doubts single  new  is quite catchy  nit was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon  the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back  nthe result  na movie thats just as good as that song  really  nit follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend  nfirst we hear about a grocery bagger  sara polley  who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave  with bad results  as a drug dealer feels hes been swindled by her   then comes the story of an english grocery store worker  same store  who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends  where sex  gunplay  and stolen car trouble come into play  then we see the story of two gay movie actors  played by scott wolf and jay mohr  who deal with a cops strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl  sara  with their car  and  finally  we come to another grocery worker  katie holmes  who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer  the one mentioned earlier   nreally  its all confusing to keep track of in review format  your best bet is to just  well  go  nthe movie features some very good acting from all angles  and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product  nthe dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized  not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending  nthink of it as a  well  ending  nthe intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie  as its never really confusing and tells different sides of the story  like sliding doors kinda did  nhowever  its better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks  which sliding doors kinda isnt  n\n",

relax a bit  nsleep in  neat pancakes at noon  nmicrowave an egg in its shell  nwatch pro wrestling with the sound off  nlisten to some barry white records at high speed  nwhatever  nbut do not  under

ignorant  inbred  turtleneck hick  of a mechanic named darrell  nwhile darrell puts a new hose on the ride  bobby walks into town to see whats cooking  nis it needless of me to say that superior

bit by a tarantula  gets shot at  and ends up with vultures circling overhead  all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick  nbobby as terminator  nstretch it a bit  and we have a fivefinger discount from doc hollywood  where the whole story occurs because of car trouble  forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic  nokay  hes working from a book  so maybe ollies not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas  ni just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative  ni just wish he hadnt brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toestub  nsean penn gives a great performance  and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be  playing over-the-top caricatures of stereotype characters . \\nthe best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety-blank is going on . \\ntoo bad it\\'s not fun to watch when it\\'s happening to us . . . while \\nwe sit through this mess of a film . \\nu-turn is not a bad film if you\\'re a fan of technique . \\nit\\'s the oliver stone you\\'ve always known . \\nrobert richardson is his usual cinematographer , and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick -- great camera angles , shifting viewpoints , wicked colors , nice looking pictures . \\nbut pictures of what ? \\ni think i\\'d rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt-o-whirl point of this loser film . \\nplot twists are one thing , repetition is almost unforgivable , and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie i\\'ve seen in the past five years . \\noliver , i know your

people can tell him about the company  nwhat he doesnt realize is that the game has already begun  nthe phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas way  nhow he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive  nthe detail involved in finchers shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them  nwith  seven   fincher had almost every single shot mean something  nhe also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to  ncompared to  seven   though  the game is light and comical  nbecause of this films sense of humor and selfawareness  nothing can be taken quite seriously  nso dont try to make much sense of what goes on in the game  because it doesnt want you to  nwhat does make sense is the final revelationwhen everything becomes apparent and clear  nif taken as it is  the games ending makes complete sense  nbut if you try and critique every minute detail  then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility  nperhaps that is the reason i docked the film  nwhile trying to remain realistic and plausible  the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen  nwe dont really care if douglas character lives or not because it isnt believable  nthe ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously  but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is  you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller  nmichael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas  ndouglas has played lonely businessmen before  but here he adds another level to his performance  nhis character  who is normally levelheaded and relies on facts  is forced to trust nobody  ncan he believe the waitress he bumped into  nwhat about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place  ndouglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well  and gives one of his best performances  even better than his  falling down  persona   nthe supporting cast is essential in this film  and casting was critical  nsean penn is always good  and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas brother  ndeborah kara unger  from  crash   is the waitress he bumps into  and her performance is extremely good  nin fact  she almost steals the film from douglas  njames rebhorn portrays his character very well  and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas predicament  nanother good performance comes from armin muellerstahl  from  shine   as the book editor  nbut considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game  he not only commands this cast  but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life  nthe game is rated r for language  violence  some gore  and some nudity and drugs  nwhat is essential for this film to work is the writing  njohn brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue  and some very funny moments  nthis screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects\\' did . \\nhowever , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot . \\nand if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year\\'s best films . \\n'\n"

to go to japan or to go home to andy  buzz and the boys invade als toy barn  where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesnt know hes a toy  nthe new buzz generates the movies biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on  zurgs fortress   i  e   als apartment building   nthe original  toy story  won me over because its central themes reflected a grownup sensibility rather than the usual thisiswhatwethinkkidswanttohear  nwhile most kids movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill  in  toy story  buzz discovered that he wasnt special  that he was just like everyone else  nbuzz sank into a suicidal depression  but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy  nin other words  its okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life  nmost of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that were not space rangers

will likely be discarded  abandoned  or sealed up in a dark box in the attic  nthis is another big grownup theme  everything ends  nthe theme is introduced early in the movie when woodys arm is torn

nthe brief substitution of a new  still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise  id wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original  nmost of the vocal performances are firstrate  ntom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work  nhowever  one voiceover also stands out as horribly miscast  nkelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector  nalthough he does a lot of voiceover work in commercials and on  the simpsons   as sideshow bob   grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice  nhe doesnt have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete  nthe animation is even better than in the first  nespecially impressive were the textures of the figures  nwe can now see the difference between flesh and plastic  in the first movie the people looked just like the toys  but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint  nwe can also see that bo peep is porcelain  nas you can tell from the longwinded phrasing common in the merchandising   disney and pixars toy story    this is pixars coming out party  nto celebrate they appended their first project , a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball , to the beginning of the movie . \\nthey made the short in 1986 , which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then . \\non the downside , \" toy story 2 \" follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale , and some sections tend to drag . \\noverall , though , i had a great time and found \" story 2 \" to be a worthy successor to the first \" toy story . \" \\nbottom line : this one really is fun for the whole family ! \\n'\n",

instinctive characterizations  but to accommodate the convoluted plot  nin a lightweight comedy  you might say  it is not required to have perfectly realized figures  just as long as they get the job done  nunfortunately  for a comedy to work  it has to at least succeed at being funny  and if there was a laughometer available  id guess that it briefly ascended around    of the time for me

unsatisfying and emptyheaded excursion into wellworn terrain already set by far superior pictures  nhow the cast  most of which are respectable actors  got caught up in such a cliched  deficient film

      "bthe following review encompasses two versions of dune  ndune  the theatrical version    runtime   minutes capsule review  cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives  the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book  nthe films visual splendour  mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative  ndune  the extended version    runtime   minutes capsule review  a bit of a throwtogether assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television  nit was disowned by director david lynch but its considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline  nquality dubs of this version from the outofprint japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web  n    the review    nreleased in  and made on a then mammoth budget of  million  the film of frank herberts cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by scifi fans  ndirector david lynch  blue velvet  eraserhead  twin peaks  was working on his biggest production to date  a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico  nthe screenplay was lynchs own  chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected  ndune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors  nthe key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis  dune   a windswept desert planet thats home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange  nthe spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe  nit extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it  nmost importantly  it allows the navigators of the spacing guild  once human but now hideously mutated  to  fold space  and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously  enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish  nlynchs film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the storys two main strands  none is the longstanding rivalry between two families  houses atreides and house harkonnen  and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis  nthe second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah longawaited by the natives of arrakis  the fremen  nthe deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld  and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom  nunfortunately  this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film  which runs  to  minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended  nthe thinking among universals ohsowise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office  nwith lynchs initial cut running at closer to three or more hours  the studio demanded that further cuts be made  nwhat a great idea  nwhy not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible  nthe most glaring consequence of this oneeyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative  leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters  nthus their personalities are vague  their motivations unclear and  in the case of pauls father duke leto  their demise rather meaningless  nthe end result is a distinct chill  we cant warm to most of the cast and we dont care much for them  nand it hardly helps that the voiceover narration is sparse and that the duneesque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book  ndune is also a very serous film  nthe constant  selftalk  by various characters makes it so serious and selfabsorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment  nthe overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them  nhumour  or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnens mad  sadistic kind  is hard to find  nyou may balk at the comparison  but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus star wars trilogy  nthe theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster  however  nit still possesses enough of lynchs stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative scifi  nspecial effects whiz carlo rambaldis giant sandworms are an awesome sight  nboth the production design  anthony masters  and costume design  bob ringwood  are striking and original  nand the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years  nwith these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis lush cinematography  the film is at least a feast for the senses  nsee it in the widescreen format if you can  nand despite all the cuts  several cast members still make a strong impression  most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen  nsian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam  leader of the bene gesserit religious order whos secret aim is to manipulate pauls destiny for its own shadowy ends  nas paul atreides  the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily  but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade  nthe conclusion  nany assessment of this film must take into account that frank herberts original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker  ndavid lynch took a brave stab at it and  partly due to forces beyond his control  ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects  ndune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release  nmany chose to stay away altogether  as the films disastrous box office showing attests  nthe extended version  however  is a rather different beast  nin  lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition  directors cut  of the film on home video  a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres  nbut , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . \\nin a way , then , it is partly lynch\\'s own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . \\nstung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director\\'s guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with \" allen smithee \" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . \\nhe also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous \" judas booth \" . \\ncertainly , looking at the results of mca\\'s handiwork there\\'s at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . \\nbut these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . \\nmost of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version\\'s storyline . \\npaul\\'s relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . \\nthe political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . \\npaul\\'s initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . \\nand as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . \\nas a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv\\'s version of dune is clearly superior . \\nas a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . \\nthe use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . \\nthere\\'s some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . \\nand the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . \\nships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . \\nthis is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . \\nit should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . \\nbut the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn\\'t even in herbert\\'s book . \\nthe scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his \" heart plug \" . \\nits a surreal and disturbing episode that\\'s very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . \\ndespite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . \\nall up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . \\nunless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the \" alan smithee \" version remains the closest we\\'ll get to what the movie should have been . \\non repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . \\nstill , as one of this century\\'s great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . \\nwith rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . \\n'\n"

are two of the worst examples of this  and now ice from the sun can be added to this list  nthis film is essentially an  minute stalkandslash film  following the dantes inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street  through   intercut with almost  minutes of strange and  supposedly  haunting images  many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot  nif there arent bizarre images floating past the screen  then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or

least the music in the film is pretty decent  made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett  nat the beginning of the film it is established that the

      "bon june     a selftaught  idealistic  yet pragmatic  young man became  at age   the first head of government of a newly independent african state  formerly the belgian congo  ntwo months later  he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides  nthis littleknown story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in  lumumba   npatrice lumumbas  eriq ebouaney  story has been told previously by helmer peck in his  award winning documentary   lumumba  death of a prophet   virtually guaranteeing that his new  fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject  npeck  with cowriter pascal bonitzer  begins at the end of the story of the young political leader  nwe watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men  nimages of hatchets  saws and fastemptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image  njump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgianowned congo  na third class postal worker  lumumba  speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes  proclaiming himself not tribal  not regional  but a national leader  nhis small  mobile party  the congolese national movement  mnc  is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer  and get his face known  in the bustling capital  stanleyville  nat a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world  lumumba is in the right place at the right time and  through political savvy and chesslike manipulation  achieves a position of leadership of the mnc  nas the date for independence approaches  he tactically positions himself to be the new nations first prime minister and defense minister  supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu  maka kotto   nthe coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the countrys vast natural resources of copper  diamonds  gold and more  nlumumba wont seek the help of the us  knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government  nhis initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination  nthe situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies  the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves  belgian troops violently intervene  the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe  pascal nzonzi  and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad  nthis tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimesodious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries  npeck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba  his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the s and s  n  during the time the story takes place  many new nations  including nigeria and somalia  were born  with varying degrees of success and failure  usually dependent upon which country colonized them  nsome colonial masters were better than others   nthe effort involved in  lumumba  is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades  if at all  nproduction values are first rate on what must be a small  by us standards  budget  nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique  nthe screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeomans work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumbas life  nthe political side of things is evenly told in a linear  straightforward manner that teaches  not preaches  nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man  if a bit as a stalwart saint  but doesnt embellish on a larger than life persona  nthe family side of patrices life is handled in several  perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children  embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child  ni know the intent is to flesh the man out  but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba  nthe story  as such  has a lopsided feel about it  nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character  nthe actor gives a convincing  charismatic performance as the multifaceted  politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions  nin true docudrama tradition  the supporting cast does not outshine the star  complementing his good efforts  instead  n  lumumba  is a solid  interesting  educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos  both  nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything ive seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b  n\n",

      "bthe first image in  final fantasy  the spirits within  is a computeranimated closeup of a human eye  nits a beautiful piece of work  remarkably detailed and quite convincing  nwhen the picture pulls back to reveal the owner of the eye  however  things change  nthe young woman has mesmerizing hair  although it hangs too artfully  even by movie standards  to be believed  nthe facial features are more detailed than any computeranimation seen to date  but the result is more reminiscent of a very wellcrafted doll than anything human  nshe is pretty  but bland  and not nearly expressive enough to come off like a person  nall the characters in  final fantasy  are like that  nof the core group  the younger white men and women are all athletic  attractive and indistinct  like applicants for a tv reality show  nthe black man is taller and burlier  and the aging scholar is bald  with wrinkles and a beard  nnone of them appear to be based on individuals  they all look like the products of general descriptions given a police sketch artist  nit gets worse when they talk and move  nwhy is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi  he of the great twisted face and snaggleteeth  coming out of the mouth of some dreary ken doll  nwhy  for every fluid physical gesture  do we also see herkyjerky puppetstyle motions  nmore to the point  who decided a fulllength computer animated movie featuring  hyperreal   their term  not mine  humanoids was a good idea  n  final fantasy  is based on a phenomenally popular video game ive never played  with a story straight out of japanese anime  which more often than not leaves me bored and depressed  nif youre a fan of either  please spare me your letters  as i will focus solely on the finished film and not its source materials  nwith an expressionchallenged cast   final fantasy  mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit  nthe result is ugly  confusing and boring  nnote  the following reveals the basic plot  nif you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie  i suggest you read it  nearth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls  nmost of our planet is devastated  with humans living in a few protected cities  nwhile the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies  aki ross  voiced by mingna  and her mentor  dr  sid  donald sutherland   believe in a more organic approach  nthey operate on the notion  quoting straight from the press kit   that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained  naki and dr  sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force  nthe waves will  in effect  cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion  nthey have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave  nthey are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out   nare you still with me  ntheres only a little more  naki is infected with the alien force  ndr  sid has developed a method of confining the contagion and keeping it from killing her  but the defense wall wont hold much longer  nalready  the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams  naiding aki and dr  sid are the deep eyes  a group of hardasnails types that would have felt at home with the troops in  aliens   ncapt  gray edwards  alec baldwin  heads the task force that consists of a wise guy  buscemi   a tough woman  peri gilpin  and a gentle giant  ving rhames   nthrowing a monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass  in this case general hein  james woods   who wants to use the zeus cannon to bomb the aliens back to the stone age  even if it destroys earth as well  nso there you have it  nlike most of the anime ive seen  the plot combines apocalyptic settings  lots of shooting and fuzzy spirituality  all wrapped up in a savetheearth bow  nbut im bored with apocalyptic settings  ni understand why so many liveaction films employ them  theyre cheap  but animated films can show anything  so why wallow in an industrial trash heap  nthe action scenes and shootemups dont satisfy either  nthe humans move oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast cant bring them to life  in fact  their efforts merely emphasize what were missing   naki is especially disappointing  with her lack of expression and flat delivery  she looks and sound like a brunet version of weena  the eloi girl from s  the time machine   ndrab color choices and aliens that appear to have been created in jello molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces  nstudents of computer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind  final fantasy  the spirits within   but i found it subpar across the board  n  futurama  does more effective battle visuals  the kids in  south park  are far more expressive than these mannequins and any old episode of the contemporary version of  the outer limits  does better doom and gloom scifi  nso who needs this  nnot me  n\n",

      "bits an interesting premise  nour reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real  nin truth  our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains  nwhat we see  what we do  everything around us is nothing more than a computergenerated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence  nour bodies  severely atrophied  are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet  nthe scifi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along  nthe matrix isnt it  the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network  a sham world  the ability to plug ones brain into a computer  has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator  dark city  and a few star trek episodes  both classic and next generation   nwhat is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thoughtprovoking  nkeanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo  who is plucked out of the artificial world  known as the matrix  by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computergenerated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines  nthe groups leader  morpheus  laurence fishburne   has chosen neo because he believes neo is  the one  who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence  nfrom the beginning of the film  we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out  nthis  in a lesser movie would be annoying  but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun  nwhat is reality  nwhat is a sham  nthe film turns our very perception of life on its side  nmore than once  we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality  or live a life of relative bliss  oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings  nas viewers  this is intriguing enough  so imagine what it would be like for neo  nand who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves  nreeves  whom ive never really cared for as an actor  is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness  and little subtlety  nhe was good in speed  for example  but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds  nneo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely  so much of my expectation was happily for naught  nin a couple of places  the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature  and this is a heavy credit to writersdirectors andy and larry wachowski  ni mean  since bill and teds excellent adventure  what movie could you say really  utilized  keanu reeves  nmore interesting than reeves is fishburne  whos morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions  and convincingly so  nvery surprising for a scifi movie  nfishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout  as if he always knows what to expect  nthis helps to further the aura of his characters proficiency and extensive knowledge  nhugo weaving as agent smith  one of the artificial intelligences antiintruder programs  is also good playing his deadpan  nononsense  kick ass role  which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time  nunfortunately  when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row  the nature of his characters speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive  ncarrieanne moss plays trinity  morpheuss number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo  nalthough her character is somewhat inconsistent  moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isnt in the picture  nthere were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects  nmany methods of imagery are employed  from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics  nof special note is the use of the  freeze and turn  effect where the entire scene is frozen  turned  then continued from a new angle  nthis is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semicircle  with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends  nthe motion cameras film the action  and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once  nplace each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second  npretty slick  nthe matrix drips with style  nfrom the clothing to the music to the action  were watching an exaggerated version of what were used to  nmuch of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film  theres a lot of kung fu  theres a lot of gunplay  nwhen a character is letting go with an automatic weapon  much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion  ntheres also the element of the japanese action cartoon  called anime by aficionados   especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects  ncombined  its really like no liveaction film i have ever seen  nthe film is not without its faults  nsome of the scenes and ideas are  borrowed  a little too liberally from other films  and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing  nsome of the lines are also pretty bad  in one instance  a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying  and it wasnt meant to be a joke  nhowever  these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action scifi film that for once does more than merely entertain  n\n",

      "bcapsule  sidesplitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end    nbut not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs  nmost comedies these days have one flaw  ntheyre not funny  nthey think theyre funny  but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly  noccasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem  ruthless people  for instance  which established a microcosm of a setup and played it out to the bitter end  nliar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny  nthis is one of the few movies ive seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through  instead of a couple of setpieces that inspired a laugh  think of the dismal fatal instinct   the whole movie works like clockwork  njim carrey playes a highpowered lawyer  to whom lying is as natural as breathing  nthere is one thing he takes seriously  though  his son  and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away  nbut his wife is divorced and seeing another man  and now it looks like they may move away together  nthe son goes with them  of course  nthe movie sets up this early material with good timing and a remarkable balance of jim carreys overthetop persona with reality  nthen the plot springs into action  after being snubbed  not deliberately  by his father at his birthday  the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles  that for just one day  dad cant lie  nhe gets the wish  nwhat happens next is sidesplitting  neverything turns into a confrontation  when cornered by a bum for some change  he shouts   no  nim not giving you any money because i know youll spend it on booze  nall i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society   nhe cant even get into an elevator without earning a black eye  nand whats worse  hes now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture  ncarrey  who i used to find unfunny  has gotten better at his schtick  even if its a limited one  nhe uses it to great effect in this movie  nthere is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process  theres a grin breaking out across my face right now  just remembering the scene   nhe cant even write the lie  his fingers twitch  his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning  and when he tries to talk its like hes speaking in tongues  nequally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp  dont ask why   tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts in the courtroom  it fails  with semipredictable results   and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them  nthis scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end  nthe movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end  na shame  too  because the movie insists on having a big  ridiculous climax that involves carreys character flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs  then breaking his leg  etc  a simple reconciliation would do the trick  nwhy is this stupid pentup climax always obligatory  nits not even part of the movies real agenda  nthankfully  liar liar survives it  and so does carrey  nmaybe they were being merciful  on reflection  nif id laughed any more  i might have needed an iron lung  n\n",

      "b  jaws  is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen  nthe movie opens with blackness  and only distant  alienlike underwater sounds  nthen it comes  the first ominous bars of composer john williams now infamous score  ndahdum  nfrom there  director steven spielberg wastes no time  taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly  nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean  and once  jaws  has attacked  it never relinquishes its grip  nperhaps what is most outstanding about  jaws  is how spielberg builds the movie  nhe works it like a theatrical production  with a first act and a second act  nunlike so many modern filmmakers  he has a great deal of restraint  and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act  nuntil then  he merely suggests its presence with creepy  subjective underwater shots and williams music  nhes building the tension bit by bit  so when it comes time for the climax  the sharks arrival is truly terrifying  nhe doesnt let us get bored with the imagery  nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody  roy scheider   a new york cop who has taken an easy  peaceful job running the police station on amity island  a fictitious new england resort town where there hasnt been a murder or a gun fired in  years  nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july  and the mayor  larry vaughn  murray hamilton   doesnt want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money  nbrody is joined by matt hooper  richard dreyfuss   a young  ambitious shark expert from the marine institute  nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it  his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark   its a perfect engine  an eating machine   make it that much more terrifying  nwhen vaughn finally relents  hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint  robert shaw  on his decrepit boat  the orca  to search for the shark  nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark  and inevitably  are hunted by it  n  jaws  is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing  tension  and horror  nit is like ten movies all rolled into one  and its no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of   taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time  until it was unceremoniously dethroned in  by  star wars    neven today  fascination with this film is on par with hitchcocks  psycho   and it never seems to age  nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences  including several mechanical sharks  obsolete  none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill  nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in  may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing  characterization  sharp editing  and creative photography  instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects  nscheider  dreyfuss  and shaw were known actors at the time  jaws  was made  but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman  nnevertheless  this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark  nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing whats right and going against the entire town  n  its your first summer here  you know   mayor vaughn warns him  ndreyfuss  who had previously been seen in  american graffiti     and  the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz     gives a surprisingly mature  complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers  nhowever  most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movies captain ahab  a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards  nbordering of parody  shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism  nhes slightly deranged  and shaws performance is almost a caricature  nhowever  there is one scene late in the film  when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars  nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u  s  s  nindianapolis  a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese  nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over    other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hairraising than anything spielberg put on screen  nshaw delivers the story in one long take  and it is the best acting in the film  nof course  we cant leave out the shark itself  with its black eyes  endless rows of teeth  and insatiable urge to eat  it is basically the epitome of all mankinds fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature  na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real  having survived sinch the dinosaurs  great whites do exist  they can be as large as the shark in  jaws   and they are a threat  nevery one of spielbergs subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark  a bunch of writihing  dangling  completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into  \\nthe shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \\nmany have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie\\'s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \\nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \\n'\n"

worked in some capacity on that quasilandmark feature  while bruno may have studied under camerons wing for years and years  im beginning to wonder at what capacity  and what exactly did he learn from him  nin fact   virus  should at least be mediocre  the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron  a director who  if anything  just knows how to make a movie  and then make a film

has taken over all the machines on board  have meshed the machines with parts from corpses  and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary  ha ha   nnot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving  not only does this film start off with a chintzy bondian opening  the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir   destroying any of the suspense in what could happen  but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters  nof its motley crew  it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper  a masculine potentialromanticinterest  a drunken captain  a black technician  a tatooed aborigine  a manic russian survivor  and a couple other candidates for alien food  none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin  plain piece of writing paper  nand its not the traditional argument for films like these  where you may in fact want them all to be eaten  even  aliens  played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers  but this was more of a plusside for the film as a whole than the opposite   instead  as another cliche goes  you just dont give a damn  ni almost dont even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from subpar to horrific  the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is  and she is  just not really here  and the latter being  and it pains me to say this as hes a particular favorite of mine  donald sutherland  who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that

up on the potential oscarnominees   it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film  its laden with complex machinery  boasts respectable production design  and it may even feature believable special effects    if  of course  i  or anyone else  could see them  n  virus  mostly takes place on a large  abandoned cruiser  and mostly at night until the dawn  and mostly without the use of lights  not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey  but more so because  as the hollywood cliche seems to go   if its dark enough  then the special effects will be more believable   nand if you dont believe me  go back and rent  godzilla   and tell me if theres even one shot where we see godzilla either a  in his entirety in one wide shot  or b  n the light so that we can at least see him  well  you don't really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . \\nbut all of this doesn\\'t matter since \" virus \" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie . \\nthe action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i\\'ve ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn\\'t figure it out when i saw it ) . \\nimagine the first attack of the aliens in \" aliens , \" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that\\'s basically the whole of \" virus \" : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . \\nand my god , it\\'s a long damn sit . \\nwith no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it\\'s a wonder that it even got made . \\nwe already know that big movie studios\\' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like \" out of sight \" and \" saving private ryan \" give you more faith in them , but movies like \" virus \" manage to drain a little more out of the pool . \\ni almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . \\nthey read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face . \\neven though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i\\'d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . \\nin fact , shouts of \" egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? \" \\nare not only justifiable , but encouraged . \\n'\n"

      "bits been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller  where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters  but its been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually  shock  cared for the characters  not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles  flaws  and strengths to emerge so radiantly  nid saw that its been at least a couple decades  even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers  though im hardly comparing  a simple plan  to  say   rear window  or  strangers on a train   nyet its almost as good  nits simple  yet strangely complex  and astonishingly rewarding  because instead of moving from plot point to plot point  and merely laying out theymightbecaught overtones  it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to  all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral  nelegantly directed by sam raimi  yes  the same    a simple plan  concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright  moderately financially stable working man  bill paxton   his dimwitted brother  billy bob thornton   and his drinking buddy  brent briscoe   nwithout anyone around  and the possibility that no one would come looking for it  the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes  they will keep it  but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking  and so they generally dont flaunt anything they dont want to flaunt  theyll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton  nthe possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse  a  they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities  b  they could try to fight off the rightful owners  who are either villainous or just  or c  they could fight amongst themselves  n  a simple plan   though borrows a little from each of these  na little tiff with the cops here  a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent  a chilling gary cole  there   and a bit of inside feuding over here  nbut  as austin powers would say  thats not necessarily its bag  baby   nwhat i most admired about this film  and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that its successfully able to have its cake and eat it too  nit effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches  like the ones mentioned above  but at the same time  it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag  nso while steps are taken to neatly cover things up  and these subsequent steps go miserably awry  the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to  they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity  nin one early scene  paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesnt look like it was all stolen  not a bad idea   when thornton screws up  as he does continuously throughout the movie   and paxton has to do some major coveringup  read  homicide   ninstead of a quick murder and immeadiate handswashing  raimi shows a lengthy  painful shot from a lowangle onto paxtons face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion  ntheres a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder hes committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective  but the previous shot is even better  more morally complex and more gutwrenching  nin short  probably the best piece of direction raimis ever done  demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results  for further proof  watch  persona  s  sex scene  and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergmans ever done   nbut the film hardly stops here  it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof  nyet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story  nwhen the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical  with aid from his pregnant wife  played by bridget fonda  a pal to raimi   he does  and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights  ntheres at least two grand shootouts  and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history  and when they arrive  they dont come with masochistic delight but with cringeinducing horror  nduring the one  i was actually sinking into my chair  with the mantra  they cant do this  can they   nstreeming through my head  nin fact  this film  which is getting many comparisons to the coens superior  but forget about it  fargo   has many similar moments of manic insanity  attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what  in other hands  would be overthetop distractedness  imagine  i suppose  robert rodriguez directing this    then nagain  after seeing the  evil dead  films  id hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off  although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed  raimi  moments  a rifleshot notwithstanding   ninstead  raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch  easily letting the story and characters coexist  while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out  like some offbeat comic touches  nmost particularly  billy bob thorntons character  jacob  is a brilliant creation  nhis dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there\\'s authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we\\'re not totally laughing at him . \\nthe chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real . \\njacob\\'s a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money . \\nthe final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great . \\ni particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character . \\nthornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he\\'s ever given and further proof that he\\'s the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don\\'t believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in \" primary colors , \" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn\\'t been in the same year ) because he\\'s easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable . \\nhe brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it\\'s difficult picturing anyone else in the role . \\nthe rest of the cast is great too , from paxton\\'s declining working man to chelcie ross\\' amiable town sheriff . \\neven fonda shows off her talents nicely . \\nand if i had any complaints about the film , it\\'s that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved . \\nand the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you\\'re trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn\\'t raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) . \\nand , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss . \\ni won\\'t reveal it , but it\\'s way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn\\'t already too much of that anyway . \\nfor a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending . \\nimagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it\\'s like if in \" crime and punishment \" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i\\'m at all comparing \" a simple plan \" to dostoevsky . \\nthe ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day . \\nbut despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i\\'ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile . \\nat least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece . \\n'\n",
      "bmost people fit into two different categories  you either love woody allen  or you hate his guts  nmy family  for the most part  hates him and his movies  ni think hes very funny  but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years  nso maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of  nunrestrained by physical boundaries  allens humor comes shining through  nthose who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allens intelligent observations of life  nthose who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one  nin   a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something theyd never seen before  ntoy story used stateoftheart computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present  nmany critics will call that a better film  but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture  nantz  however  has upped the ante considerably  ndisneys a bugs life isnt due out for another two months  and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal  nby beating disney out  they have satisfied the audiences thirst for computeranimated films  nbut dont let that fool you  disney is definitely not scared  nin the past two years  competitions have broken out between studios  nin   it was the volcano duel  nin my opinion  dantes peak came out way ahead of its predecessor  both in time and in quality  nvolcano had an original premise  but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations  nin   there are twice as many competing films  nfirst was the comet competition  and armageddon blew away its cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact  nbut now  its even more interesting  as one beloved studio  disney  goes up against the newcomer  dreamworks   nwho will prevail  ntime will tell  but im sure that mr  mouse has nothing to fear  nthis may sound like i didnt like antz  on the contrary  id put it up there with toy story  nbut due to its pg rating  many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldnt appear in disneys version  nsome of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a familyoriented film  nsexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally  which makes dreamworks animated feature geared more for an adult crowd  nthe humor is also written especially for adults  though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended  nthis is the type of film that should be made for families more often  entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents  nantz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allens shtick and franz kafkas metamorphosis  the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug  nz  allen  is a troubled ant  believing he was not made to be a worker  n  when youre the middle child in a family of five million     he comments about his neglected childhood  none night  z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver  sylvester stallone   discussing his pathetic place in life  nin walks princess bala  sharon stone   whom no one recognizes without a crown  nbala asks z is he would like to dance  and they engage in a pulp fictionesque dance while everyone else is following the leader  nafter discovering that she is the princess  z falls in love  but theres a problem  bala is getting married to general mandible  gene hackman   a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony  nin order to do that  he must eliminate not only the queen  anne bancroft   but the weakest of the colony  namely the worker ants  nbut to get rid of the queen  he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her  nhe and colonel cutter  christopher walkin  come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle  where they will surely be killed  nthe queen is reluctant at first  but decides it is best for the colony  nmeanwhile  z wants to meet bala again  and he asks weaver  an army ant  to switch places with him  nso z gets sent off to battle  but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites  nthe battle sequence is absolutely stunning  though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers  which contained a very similar sequence  nhowever  antz and that  film were both in production around the same time  so the similarities are merely coincidence  nthe second half of the film revolves around zs kidnapping of bala  and their search for a mythical place called insectopia  nthere  an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants  nthe adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension  especially one involving a magnifying glass  nlooming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day  in fact  im just going to assume that the producers referenced id intentionally   nthe ants look up in awe  and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground  nvisually  its an exciting rush of adrenaline . \\nbut don\\'t be fooled . . . \\nlittle kids shouldn\\'t see this , as they may just try and copy it . \\nafter seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . \\nhopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . \\nas an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . \\nvisually , it\\'s as stunning as what dreams may come . \\nthe best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren\\'t limited by gravity . \\nthey can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible . \\none great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball . \\nthe animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . \\nhowever , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy\\'s shoe . \\nit\\'s truly a great example of film making at its finest . \\nwith computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants\\' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices . \\nthe best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) . \\nat one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . . \\ndo they ? ) . \\nbarbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body . \\nyoung kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) . \\ndisney\\'s a bug\\'s life looks good , but i don\\'t know if they will be able to best dreamworks\\' newest animated feature in terms of animation . \\nif not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) . \\nvocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story . \\nin fact , it far exceeds that one . \\nwoody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he\\'s done in the past few years . \\nwithout a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing . \\nin fact , i\\'m pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines . \\nsharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress . \\nsylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star . \\nafter a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is . \\ngene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona . \\nchristopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns . \\nanne bancroft has a minimal role , but she\\'s effective nonetheless . \\ndanny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job . \\ndan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd . \\njennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won\\'t recognize her voice either . \\nmany people will recognize grant shaud\\'s voice as the foreman . \\nhe played miles on the tv show murphy brown . \\nthis is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it\\'s grosses . \\nof course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also . \\ndirectors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) . \\nbut both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture . \\ntense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals . \\nthe screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults . \\nkids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor . \\nmost of it will go over young children\\'s heads . \\ndoes that mean you shouldn\\'t take kids to see it ? \\nnot at all . \\nthey will have a lot of fun watching this one . \\nwhat is great is the themes that are given to us . \\npart social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community . \\nthankfully , it\\'s not subtle in either aspects . \\nantz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action . \\nsometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home . \\nthe battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death . \\nand the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight . \\nbut other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it\\'s a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters . \\ni doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it\\'s still advisable to leave really young children at home . \\nhave i confused you enough ? \\nif you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you\\'ll enjoy it the most . \\n'\n"

      "bm  i  the sequel to mission impossible  is a james bond wannabe film  but it fails to even come close to that film in wit  humor  and entertainment value  nit tries to be a spyromance movie  but without any suspense the film just looks like its an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses  nit is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human  nthe coolest thing about this movie  was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie  was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols  nthe film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence  nexcept for the choreographed action sequences  the film was dull for threequarters of its time  filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed  nas for the action scenes  they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films  but their advertisement for sadistic responses  is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence  which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen  nm  i opens and closes with fastpaced action scenes  but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue  nthe film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus  at that point  nthe only thing that kept me awake  was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the films supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way  nits a megabuck film adapted from a popular hightech gadgetry tv series  nbut its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it  and it failed to produce a story that had any substance  njohn woo   broken arrow    faceoff   is good at doing car chases  choreographed fights with midair flips and kungfu kicks  slomo shots of two guns blazing  and of fire explosions  but he just cant seem to handle dialogue and suspense  nthe star of the film and coproducer  tom cruise  and his romantic interest  thandie newton  are miscast  ncruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile  as he tries to carry off this macho role  while thandie is not an actionfilm girl  and seems like a fish outofwater in this one  ntheir romance didnt work  not only was it tepid and not sexy  but it wasnt convincing  nthe film opens with dizzying speed  perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success  nwe will be in three different locations instantaneously  sydney  the american southwest  and seville  nfirst  we are in sydney  australia  where a scientist with a muffled russian accent  dr  nekhorvich  rade   mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it  nhe also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain  nwhich explains the films mythic theme    as nwe enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil  nthe one who played the villain  dougray scott  does so in a onedimensional gruff tone  which did not distinguish him in that role  nat least  if the film got the villain part right  it might have had some fun with this nonsense  nsoon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri  but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains  nbefore they crash the plane and parachute out of it  the one who was posing as dimitri  turns out to be sean ambrose  scott   a rogue member of the imf  which is a cialike clone  nhe steals the package with the antidote  peels off a latex mask  which is a replica of the hero of the story  ethan hunt  cruise   who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust  nsean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices  nwe already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in faceoff and in the original mission impossible  which as convoluted a plot as that film had  it was still a superior film to this sequel  nwoo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground  as it is used so often in this film by both sides  so much so  that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain  nit makes it seem as if anyone could be another character  which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense  nnext we are in a mountain range in the american southwest  and ethan is on vacation  hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool  when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard  delivers via a rocket launcher  a pair of talking sunglasses  nhunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help  billy baird  john polson  and luther stickell  ving rhames   with luther running a highgadget computer  but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall  thandie  to join his team  nhe is told  as an incentive to recruit her  all her criminal charges will be dropped  nhopkins then signs off with the tag line  this message will selfdestruct in five seconds  nactually  with the departure of hopkins  it was this disposable film that actually selfdestructed at this point  nin seville  hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase  where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road  nhe also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal  and learns that she is valuable because her exboyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f  ck her  nthe imf team then inject a location tracer chip

their company sell the antidote  insuring that they will make billions on the stock  nethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah  with his only conflict being who is more important to save first  nethan does this rescue against all odds  as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company  fight it out with sean and the other terrorists  and rescue nyah  who injected herself

      "bwith the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately  what with that whole clinton thing going on  you know   million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern  oh  please  government  waste my taxes just a bit more  would you    nits about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement  nwith this and  crimson tide   hes created two successfully chilly films that are interesting  exciting  even pretty smart  but never totally riveting as cinema  and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying  and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart  nthat film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them  and was appropriately scary and all  but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant  n  enemy of the state  is the same way  its engrossing for its entire running time  and its scary the way that it shows a mans decent into kafkaism  but its too technical  nits too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be  nit casts will smith  one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because hes charming and witty and never uninteresting  and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person  ni hate to do this  but last years film  the game  got it damn perfect  it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being  a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life  and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened  nthe result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling  but also the best mindfuck of the entire year  nnot that i want every kafkaesque film to be  the game   this years  the spanish prisoner  succeeds with less thrills and chills   but it should be an example of what works and what doesnt  nwill smiths character is  frankly  too perfect  at least too movie perfect  nhe had an affair with another woman  lisa bonet  ha ha   but his relationship with his wife  regina king  is basically fine regardless  nhe has a kid  and hes raking in money as a lawyer  albeit a very good and reasonably moral one  nso he generally doesnt have any real problems as a human being  and is therefore boring    except that he is played by will smith  who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering  id    men in black  territory  nhes a good dramatic actor  just see the first half hour of  six degrees of separation  for proof of this  not that he isnt great the whole time   and here  he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character  which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities  nsmith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance  extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world  under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control  when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party  a nature observer played by  uh  jason lee   nthe government wants the disk  and is prepared to destroy his life to get it  nas smiths plight is dramatized  we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him  sitting in vans disguised as other businesses  staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet  nthese guys  played by jack black  jamie kennedy  and seth green  are the most interesting part of this film because theyre  well  fascinating  theyre doing their jobs  which are evil  but the film doesnt view them as such  and they almost become our friends  nwe like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesnt automatically judge them as the villains  ntheyre also scary because we get the idea that theyre not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world  nits as if theyre obsessed with their jobs  not because theyre evil  but because  hey  its a fun job  and no one else can do it like them  nunfortunately  this also backfires a bit on the film  instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that  the game  was  you see everything  and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on  nsure  youre chilled  but youre not exacty freaked out by whats going on  nbut what do you expect from tony scott  the man who never met a fivesecond piece of film he ever liked  nhes a notbad director because  hell  he is always interesting to watch  if not occasionally moronic  exhibit a   days of thunder    but the reason hes not great is because hes too technical and calculated  nhis shots are perfectly executed  and leave nothing to the imagination  and theyre always making sure youre paying attention  nthis is incredibly annoying  and it reduces  enemy of the state  to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths  but still manage to entertain without any real problems  ndespite never actually becoming great  its never actually boring and its always intriguing . \\nwatching the government set-up smith is endlessly fascinating , and since we care about smith\\'s likeable protagonist , we are set-up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy-esque entertainment . \\nadd the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film ( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos ) , and you\\'ve got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith\\'s plight without a minute\\'s worth of boredom . \\n'\n"

      "bdirector luis mandokis last film was the superb  serious  drama  when a man loves a woman   but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture   message in a bottle   which is the worst type of romance  a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up  neverything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times beforeand much betterso theres an absence of suspense  and the film ultimately moves at such a very  very deliberate pace  as if it is trying to make great   meaningful  statements and plot developments  that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through  n  message in a bottle  begins with theresa osborne  robin wright penn   a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune  whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day  ninside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine  and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and  to her objection  finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper  nsoon  a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message  and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake  theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks  a boating town in north carolina  to find out the specifics of the message  nof course  garrett turns out to be a handsome  rugged man around theresas age and played by kevin costner  nshe is immediately charmed by him  but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there  and finds that catherine was garretts late wife who died a few years earlier  ndo you think you know where this is headed  nmost likely you do  and i wouldnt call it giving away anything to say that by the pictures end  the movie has fallen into deep  artificial melodrama that i didnt buy for a second  nif there are any positive things to say about  message in a bottle   it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman  as garretts stubborn  but loving father  are far above par to be in such a wasteful   shaggy dog  love story  and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast  and paints chicago as an equally alluring city  nmeanwhile  costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the lessthanstellar films that he has made recently  nit seems that with such bad luck  he wouldnt want to make another movie set near water  but here he is again with one of the main  and most ridiculous  centerpieces set on a stormswept sea  nthe other actors are all  sadly  wasted  including illeana douglas  an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the  friend  roles  here playing penns confidante and coworker at the tribune  nthe first half of  message in a bottle  plays like a humdrum  trite television movie for the lifetime channel  as theresa spends a great deal of time  getting to know  garrett  with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining  nusually  i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogueladen sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships  but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt  written   and not as if people were really  talking   nwhen the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other  and are not particularly interesting themselves  you know immediately that you are in trouble  ni swear that while watching  message in a bottle   i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater  heck  in actuality im not even familiar to the novel this is based on  by nicholas sparks   nalways one step ahead of the characters  the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the triedandtrue hollywood melodrama  the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing  nnobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresas secret  and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after  nthis same exact problem occurred in last years very  very similar  watch this  and you will realize just how similar i mean  meg ryannicolas cage romantic drama   city of angels   nalthough theresa is deeply touched by the  heartfelt  letter that she finds in the bottle  perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own  preferably before filming began  nit should have read   memo to screenwriters  use you brain   n\n",

      "ban astonishingly difficult movie to watch  the last temptation of  christ may be scorseses most important film  and yet his most  impossibly abstract as well  nscorsese presents the life of jesus  christ  through nikos kazantzakis novel  which details the life of  christ from approximately  until the day of crucifixtion  njesus of  nazareth  dafoe  is a carpenter  who opens the film making crosses  so  that he can escape the fate he is subjected to  his destiny on earth  n yet  he soon learns his evil ways for aiding in the deaths of others   and subjects himself to a desert in exile  in hopes that he can reach  god  nbefore leaving  he asks for forgiveness from mary magdelene   barbara hershey   a prostitute who is also a childhood friend of jesus  n  nafter going to the desert  christ learns his true purpose in life   and what he must do  naided by judas  keitel   he sets off on teaching  the world his message  nalong the way  he meets john the baptist  the  rest of the prophets  and tries to teach the world his message  nchrist  is also confronted by internal demons and selfdoubt  as he tries to  find his true purpose throughout the entire film  nduring the story   judas is the closese ally of jesus  his betrayal  argues the film  was  not out of hate  but out of love  in order to allow christ to die  n nhe is eventually captured  and crucified as per the bibile  n however  as he is about to die on the cross  he is saved by a girl  who  brings him to his marriage with mary magdelene  nthe girl is a guardian  angel who is from god  and who has saved him from his death  njesus goes  on to live a life as a man  as a carpenter  and does not die on the  cross  non his deathbed  in the final moments of his life  he is visited  by the prophets  and by judas  who denounces his master for  not keeping  his end of the bargain   njudas reveals the angel to truly be the devil   and the life jesus had lived to be the ultimate selfish act  njesus  escapes from his deathbed  and asks his father for forgiveness  for  succumbing to his last temptation  nvisually and aurally  the film is absolutely breathtaking  nno other  director has even come close to realizing jerusalem during the time of  christs life to the screen  npeter gabriel contributes a score than is  simply astonishing  with pulsing rhythms that capture the viewer  nthe  performances are simply exquisite  with dafoe leading the way with a  mesmerizing turn as jesus  nkeitel  although his accent is a problem  is  passionately brilliant  fighting through language to bring the character  to life  nthe visuals are also amazing  nscorsese frames his movie in a  harsh tone  leaving the impression that jesus truly is a man who is  having human frailties  nthe film  though  has many trouble spots  npaul schraders script is  one  nschrader uses modernday new york english to tell the story  along  with new york words  new york mannerisms  and new york slang speech  n the film also does not focus on the godly aspects of christ  nthere is  no underlying message behind the mans words  nthe film fails to capture  the glory and splendor of christ  nhad it faithfully explored that  aspect  than the dichotomy of jesus soul  his frailties and doubt mixed  with his unmistakable glory  would have been simply spectacular  nthe  message of christ is confused between love and violence  and the film  merely tells us jesus is great  instead of showing us his greatness  nthe film is also overlong  nit just drags in the middle  with  nothing truly happening  nchrist is a confused figure  in the sense that  the audience doesnt know who he really is  nschrader forgets to give  jesus a message  to show that he truly is the messiah  to give him the  divinity  nwithout that  he is a rambling prophet  who the audience  themselves do not believe  nthere are several moments of accidental  hilarity  and most of them occur when jesus is attempting to preach  n there are moments of brief awe and power  followed by moments of  confused hilarity  nthat said  the controversial temptation sequence is something to  behold  nit is a step in an unexpected direction  one that leaves the  audience puzzled  until the arrival of the disciples  nit is a simply  breathtaking scene  with jesus about to die as a mortal  nit is truly  one of scorseses finest moments  nit is unfortunate that scorsese  couldnt make a film about christ as powerful as that one scene  n n'\n",

      "burban legend surprised me  nbased on the last few films the genre has produced  including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer  disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween  h   i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena  nthankfully  legend rose above its soggy premise to become not only a hip  scary and stylish entertainment  but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year  nyoure all familiar with the plot  a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac whos identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be  you guessed it  everybodys favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks    the nonly person you didnt suspect  nhowever  just because legend doesnt really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it cant qualify as firstclass entertainment  nit was  believe it or not  one of the funnest times ive had at the movies all year  nthe thing is  im not really sure what made this particular stab  pardon the pun  at the genre seem so fresh and alive  nmaybe it was the abovepar performances by the movies two leads  jared leto and  cybil  actress alicia witt   nor  it could have been the on target direction by jamie blanks  nmore likely  though  it was because of the inspired premise  ni dont think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman  nurban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener  not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film  na pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when  gasp   a gas problem  heehee  forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill  none problem  though  nwould you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif  ni thought not  npredictably  the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company  nits odd  though  when you pick up a phone to realize that nobodys on the other line  nnaturally  the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off  nand the when we least expect it    whack    na decapitation  nit turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car  nso who is it this time  nthe obvious candidate is the slightly offkilter professor at the college the girl went to  none other than freddy kruger himself  robert englund   who teaches a class on urban legends  naha  nor could it be the famehungry local journalist  leto  looking for a meaty story to put on his resume  nlike all movies of this nature  one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit  nand it turns out to be  of course  the one you didnt suspect  nim not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is  but i must give credit where credit is due  nand this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been    fun  n  complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi  ca n\n",

the hearts of the inhabitants  nfood and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby  olivia williams  who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile  nshortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman  as costner is referred to for the rest of the film  become a reluctant item  nalthough the postman knows hes running a fraud  the concept of

revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists tyranny  nthe postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner  nalthough the movie appeals to my sensibilities  there are

communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments  but beyond that there are some oddities  nthe evil army is called  holnists  which sounds coincidentally like the new age  holism   but why  nis it another coincidence that it takes place in   just one year after many ancient prophesies  including the ending of the mayan calendar  predict

ngiven the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government  its asking a lot for the audience to get behind the films nationalism  neven with its numerous flaws  the movie all comes together  if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have  nits doubtful that  the postman  is going to find much of an audience  but a few of us are going to have a good time  nbesides

      "bdavid cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head  nit is one of many science fiction films  released during the last year of this millenium  that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future  nthe story unfolds in a near future  where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs  nthe world of the future is an unfriendly place  where the scared inhabitants are  hiding  in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world  nallegra geller  jennifer jason leigh   the leading game designer in the world  is testing her new virtual reality game  existenz with a focus group  nas they begin  she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun  nshe flees with a young marketing trainee  ted pikul  jude law   who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard  nunfortunately  her pod  an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program  is damaged  nto inspect it  she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her  nthe events leading up to this  and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesnt exist  as the  players  are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot  nhere the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the games perspective  ni dont intend to reveal more of the films premise  which is structured as a computer game  with  tasks  that the characters must complete to win the game  nreleased after  the matrix  and  dark city    existenz  has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films  nhowever   existenz  is moving in a different direction  with a premise of its own  na combination of dazzling special effects  brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot  made  the matrix  a rare and entertaining science fiction experience  with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade  n  existenz  has a completely different atmosphere  resembling  dark city   which is darker  more serious and less entertaining  n  existenz  has the opportunities and potential  but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored  nafter the engaging beginning  it starts to falter  nwhile i was watching the film  many left the theatre during the first hour  nand indeed   existenz  seemed as a complete failure  the actors seemed unreal  the plot and dialogue silly  unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another  nbut the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level  explaining all past events  the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes  nand jet the film fails on several issues  nprobably the best written character in the story is a game designer  who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world  than face real life  nthis is a great possibility to create a magnificent character  and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenbergs script to the limits  but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown  nexistenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies  nit is not a world worth sacrificing your life for  nits a cold  dark place where the  players  are forced to interrelate with unreal characters  eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will  nit doesnt look like a place worth even thinking about  ndavid cronenberg has been the creator of  the fly    videodrome  and  the dead zone   so its not so hard to guess that  existenz  is a violent and gory film  nbesides the regular murders of innocent people  the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a twoheaded mutated amfibium  nscenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he cant make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures  nthe way i see it  this is the films crucial failure  nit is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time  space and problems of our everyday life do not exist  a place of blooming blossoms  green forests and clear waters  a place really worth sacrificing your life for  nbecause of its lack of three dimensionality  the film looses most of its possibilities  but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes  amusing performances  especially by willem dafoe  and one interesting and important thought  depicted in many different ways throughout the movie  nduring the film  the audience is as confused as the characters  detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created  n  the matrix   despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts  ends with a light at the end of the tunnel  n  existenz  does not  nit is a one time experience  ending in blood  gore and madness  a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow  n\n"

      "bone of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made   seen  is just a few steps away from brilliance  nhowever  those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss  nthe film received mixed reviews upon release  but theres an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice  nat times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing  but the script and the ultimate payoff are excellent  nthe shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable  nthis piece of work is  intensity  nits uncomfortable to watch  yet compelling  n  i want not to look  yet i cannot turn away   nthe story creeps along slowly and deliberately  crafted by visionary director david fincher  nhe has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions  but not giving away too much too soon  nthis is the guy who directed the ominous  alien    n  seen  is even more ominous because the threat is real  nits human and  while the script takes some artistic licence  the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic  nthat is  if a human being could be so intelligent  patient  wealthy  and disillusioned  nafter the most bizarre opening credits ive ever seen  refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment   the initial character development takes place  nmorgan freeman stars as detective william somerset  a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society  nbrad pitt costars as detective david mills  the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys  nthese two fine actors give the film its human qualities  along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow  who plays tracy  mills wife   nhowever  none of them stands out above the material  nno disrespect intended  but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same  nan ironic note is that somerset has only a week  or   thats seven  days  left on the force to train his young protege  nthe title of the picture also refers to the  deadly sins  as chronicled by john milton in  paradise lost  gluttony  greed  sloth  lust  pride  envy   wrath  nincidentally  i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found  nits the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking  but i wont give that away  nas i said  this has a great ending and no one should spoil it  nanyway  the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the  sinners  suffer for it  nthe two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man  nthey learn that he was murderedforced to eat himself to death  nthe killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and  of course  somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way  nif they didnt  it would be one short movie  nthe deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story  nwe see a lot of blood  but its not especially violent  nthe suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shownlike most of the violence in  pulp fiction   n  seen  is gory  graphic  and disturbing  but all the gore is postdeath  nstill  if you tend to get queasy  dont eat food during this film  nkevin spacey plays john doe  the avenging angel who claims that hes the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings  nlike many crazy men  he has some fine ideas  but some sick ways of expressing himself  nspacey doesnt appear until the final  minutes and also doesnt receive billing in the opening credits  nhowever  its his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination  na great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not  nthis character is so well written that its hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone  nno serial killer has ever been so creative  n  seen  is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and its often a little too depressing  nwhat it lacks in those areas  it makes up for with believable dialogue  topnotch screenwriting  unexpected twists  and realistic characters  nthe technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive  nfincher uses lighting  music  and editing quite well  but his story is always the thrust of the film  nfortunately  we dont find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits  which are run backwards up the screen    nits better to imagine what paths they will follow  nthis is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget  nits got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thingthe evils of the world arent going to cure themselves  n  seen  raises some tough questions and its intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves  nuseless trivia--co-stars in 1995\\'s \" se7en \" , brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscar--pitt in \" 12 monkeys \" , spacey in \" the usual suspects \" ( for which he won ) . \\n'\n",

      "bcapsule  a hamhanded and overunderwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment  so muddled it doesnt even know what its really advocating  if anything  na time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations  and its easy to see why  it presents a strong  almost rancorously so  story  it is full of good actors  samuel l  jackson  matthew mcconaughey  sandra bullock  kevin spacey  charles dutton   and its ostensibly about some important social issue that were all tangling with  nit is not  however  a good movie  and all of the reasons ive listed above have something to do with why  nright from the beginning  the movie is deadset on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible  na pair of redneck whites  boozed and drugged out of their minds  kidnap a young black girl  abuse and rape her horribly  and leave her for dead  nafter their arrest  their father  jackson  takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial  nmcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer  and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics  nthe acting is not quite what it should be  given the cast we have  nsandra bullock  who is a good actress but not a serious one  looks clueless  spaceys accent switches itself on and off at random  and hes given a totally thankless role to play as well  a role without an iota of depth   and mcconaugheys role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box  nthe most memorable role is donald sutherlands  and his is a bit part  ni always consider it an index of a movies desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events  and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact  nthere is one scene  a riot outside the courtroom  that should have created incredible tension  but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this  nbecause the movie doesnt know what its really about  it  cant  generate any genuine tension  and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting  none of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk crossburners  which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic  ni was reminded of the despicable betrayed  which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile  graphic acts of racism as little more than an attentiongetter  nthe movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes  nfirst of all  the jackson character is not hard to judge  theres no tension in his dilemma  nhes selfadmittedly guilty and should be sent to jail  no matter how moral his crusade  nthe old saw about how no court in the land would convict him  if he was white  is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie  but its never developed into an organic component of the story  nit just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics  nanother mistake is in motivational logic  by not having the two white thugs arraigned first  or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence  say  we have that much less empathy for jacksons character  nim probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped  we are  automatically  supposed to feel empathy for him  but thats precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible  n  see the virgin spring for more on that note   nis jacksons character then simply insane  nthat prospect isnt given terribly serious treatment either  none of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works  or how lawyers get their information  nmcconaugheys character makes an important slipup late in the movie  when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense  nhow did the prosecution get this information  nhow come he didnt get it  nthe whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movies way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slambang fashion  nthis is the biggest problem  the movie isnt about jacksons character  or his dilemma  or this case  or any of its  frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction  characters  nits not ultimately about anything at all  except its stupid geareddown plot  which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending  nat two and a half hours  the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten  theres endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing  and no writing about the material that should really matter  nits all handwaving  nthe closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded  and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair  nits not easy to make a movie about something  nthe other day i saw kurosawas phenomenal rashomon  a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality  or dont   na time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as ive seen in a long time  n\n"

      "bscream  isnt quite as clever as its predecessor  but it fills the gap with a cutting wit  ndeath  even gruesome  bloody death  can be funny if handled the right way  some will be offended by this statement  but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example   nand  while theres plenty of horror to go around in scream   the latest s slasher flick incarnation  there are also a few laughs to be had  nscream  is a sliceanddice movie for those who dont take their horror too seriously  nthe success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise  nthe unexpected blockbuster  whose gross soared over the  million mark during its six month release window  opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time  na sequel was inevitable  fortunately  nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream   including director wes craven  screenwriter kevin williamson  and actors neve campbell  courtney cox  david arquette  jamie kennedy  and liev schreiber  nas stipulated by one of the  rules of sequels  uttered by a movie obsessed character in the film  the body count in scream  is higher than that in the original  nparadoxically  theres a lot less gore  nthere is blood  of course  but nothing excessive by slashermovie standards  and there are no depictions of spilled entrails  ncraven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids  na second strength of scream  is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cutout stereotypes lined up for slaughter  nafter all  weve known some of these people for two movies  its almost impossible not to care about them at least a little  nscream  opens approximately two years after the original  nas in the first picture  theres a slick  selfmocking prologue  nthis time  the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps  whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab  which is based on the  true life  events of scream   nsome of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films  its surely no coincidence that  in addition to pinkett and epps  scream  features two black characters   nshortly thereafter  she and her boyfriend have been gutted  signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders  ncraven lets loose a burst of tongueincheek creativity for the  movie within a movie  sequences  nthey give him an opportunity to openly parody scream  an act that he accomplishes with great panache  nstab features heather graham in the  casey becker  role  played in the original by drew barrymore  and tori spelling as  sidney prescott   neve campbell   nsadly  we only see a couple of scenes from stab  nit would have been a little more fun  i think  had craven used joe dantes approach from matinee and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production  nfollowing the prologue  we are reintroduced to sidney prescott  who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college  nher friend randy  jamie kennedy  is a student there as well  and hes just as knowledgeable about horror films as ever  nonce the double murder at stab becomes big news  the media converges on windsor  looking to interview the original victim  nat the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers  courtney cox   who has a little surprise for sidney  nshe has brought cotton weary  liev schreiber   the man sidney falsely accused of murder  with her  nalso arriving at the college is deputy dewey  david arquette   who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations  nin addition to the survivors from the original scream  the field of potential victims is wellpopulated  ntheres a blond coed named cece  sarah michelle gellar  who has now appeared in two of williamsons movies  this one and i know what you did last summer   sidneys requisite boyfriend  derek  jerry oconnell   a local newswoman  laurie metcalf   gales new cameraman  duane martin   a british drama teacher  david warner   and several sorority sisters and wouldbe sorority sisters  portia de rossi  rebecca gayheart  elise neal  marisol nichols   nultimately  there are lots of attractive corpses  nfrom the stab scenes to lines like  brothers dont last long in situations like this   craven and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun with scream   and the movie is enjoyable  if a little overlong  the livelier first hour is better than the second   ntheir resolution to the obligatory  whodunit   nis less of a letdown than it could be  and knowingly offers a wink and nod at past unmasking scenes  n   nice twist   quips the killer  n  didnt see it coming  didya  \" ) \\none senses , however , that , by the end of this picture , the overall concept of a hip , self-referential slasher film has been played out . \\nsupposedly , there\\'s going to be a scream 3 , but , if the film makers don\\'t come up with something radical , we could end up with a classic case of sequel overkill . \\n'\n"

order to portray burning problems of s america  its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade  nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides  nhis travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today  many of us share his feelings of isolation  loneliness and outrage towards crime  drugs  prostitution and senseless street violence  nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him  sometimes in most unusual circumstances  like with secret service agents  pimps or job interviewers  make him a person too goofy to be the hero  and too pathetic to be the classic villain  nhowever  most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen  nbut despite anything  average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis  his crusade against  scum  is something that average person wants  but doesnt have a stomachlack of brains to do it  nwhile de niros travis might come in and out of particular times and places  other

feeling of pessimism cant be washed away even by ironic happy end  ntravis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation  and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order

stygian atmosphere  nanother important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman  whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture  none of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was  same as his protagonist  famous for the wrong reason  ninstead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits  for many years it was tabloidfodder because of hinckley and his reallife reenactment of events in the movie  nnow  more than two decades later  when some other  life imitating art  incidents

completely taken over by her own shame  she has no option but to agree to her forceful motherinlaws requests  even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman  nmaybe because  leila  is from iran  the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences  since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence  nleila  however  is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily  but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy  no matter what the circumstances  none of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza  who married only three months after their first meeting  but obviously love each other very deeply  nit is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful  and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible  nalthough seemingly unimportant at first glance  an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing  nearly uncontrollably  actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half  as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another  nditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday  and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her  nthese  small  moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn  outraging sequences in the latter half  in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road  and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman  nleft there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage  foolishly unbeknownst to reza  leila prays each time that the date will not go well  so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer  nrefusing to stay over at her parents house  the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman  and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency  leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart  as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below  ndespite her initial agreement to such a thing  leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza  whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him  nsure  the whole second marriage was his mothers idea  but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children  then he could have still easily backed out  couldnt he  nin the pivotal role of leila  who appears in every scene  leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable  injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength  unavoidable vulnerability  and utter despair  nunlike most american films  in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences  hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words  nevery bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa  as reza  a man who  i believe  does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife  but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else  nfor all of its strong aspects   leila  isnt a perfect film  non a technical level  i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed  nand concerning the plot developments  the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before  nmehrjuis decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice  particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful motherinlaw  played memorably by jamileh sheikhi  ndespite these minor missteps   leila  is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may  release at new yorks cinema village  and then on may  in la  nthe thoughtprovoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales  and when the climax arrives  leilas selfworth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation  to which there is no return  nits difficult to not consider how leilas culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided  had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila  the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme  was going through  n\n"

      "bquentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers  nafter his pulp fiction  many actors began receiving many offers for jobs  njohn travolta made his comeback and is now one of todays most bankable stars  nbruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor  njackie brown  on the other hand  boasts quite a well known cast  except for the main lead  pam grier  nmost likely you have heard of her and seen her in films  but shes never really had a breakthrough performance  her first film was in the roger ebertwritten beyond the valley of the dolls   nthat is  until now  njackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino  whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction  nafter mediocre acting jobs  tarantino returns to what made his name a household one  directing and writing  njackie brown is the result  and it is fantastic entertainment  ndespite excellent direction from tarantino  the cast steals the film  giving one good performance after another  npam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown  and she is supported by an incredible mix of talentsamuel l  jackson  bridget fonda  michael keaton  robert de niro  and robert forster  nmore than likely  you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations  ndescribing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult  as you really cant say much or you spoil it for everyone else  ni will tread lightly  njackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown  grier  in a blue outfit walking through the airport  nthe camera tracks along with her  and ends up revealing her occupation  nwe are also introduced to ordell robbie  jackson   who sells illegal guns to interested buyers    nfor a hefty price  nms  brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away  nhowever  an fbi agent  keaton  and a local l  a  cop  michael bowen  are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money  nthey try to reach him through beaumont livingston  chris tucker   one of ordells buyers  but he mysteriously ends up dead  nthey try again through brown  but she is hesitant to admit to any wrongdoing  nbut after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordells friends  fonda   she is caught and sent to jail  nordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent  max cherry  forster   and then wants to find out what she told the cops  nafter she claims to have said nothing  she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison  nordell doesnt like this  but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track  nthis scheme seems to be going as planned  but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal  nrevealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown  and thats the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film  ntarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments  and slang terms   but they are always done very well and believably  nhis hitmen are normally cruel  but pleasant  in that nasty sort of way  nthey talk like normal people  except for when doing business  and they are rude to their girlfriends  nof course  this is a tarantino film  and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise  nand perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop  nof course  tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film  adding a lot of his reservoir dogsstyle storytelling to it  nthings are told from one persons perspective  and then from another  and then from another  each time learning more and more  nthis all leads up to a very interesting conclusion  which decides who is on whose side  non the technical side of jackie brown  quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his  film  nhowever  this time around it isnt as nearly as impressive or original  nthe writing  on the other hand  is quite good  although i do find tarantinos use of slang terms offensive  nthe story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction  but its much more easy to understand  nhis previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation  but jackie brown is very simply to follow  especially considering that the time is given during the  leaps  in time  nperhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel  rum punch  by elmore leonard  nthe dialogue is pretty much intelligent  and all the characters are fully realized  nthe cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro  who has worked with tarantino on previous films  and the editing is very good  nand as with pulp fiction  the music is a highlight  bringing back memorable songs from the s and s  nthe acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable  nthe performances are incredibly rich  with hidden meaning behind every characters actions  nnothing is quite as it seems  and you cant really tell which side one person is on  nthe real treat  of course  is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown  nher poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits  which play an important role in the film  nwatching grieg  i could tell what was going through her mind  even if i didnt know what she was thinking  nher face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad  happy  or in deep thought  nbridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato  ni didnt even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits  her performance actually reminded me of heather grahams in boogie nights   nmichael keaton comes across very well  as does michael bowen  nchris tucker has a small , but effective performance . \\nsamuel l . jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) . \\nbut no matter . . . \\njackson is very strong in his role . \\nrobert de niro is actually a little annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell\\'s perspective clients and friends . \\nrobert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most developed characters . \\nhe is present throughout most of the film , and he holds his own against jackson and grier . \\njackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and some offensive remarks . \\nas a film by itself , jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment , with a complex plot to draw viewers in . \\nhowever , one can not help but compare it to tarantino\\'s pulp fiction , and expect great results . \\nwhen compared , it comes up short , but not that short . \\nit\\'s a worthy effort , with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino . \\nperhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress . \\ni can\\'t remember seeing her in anything ( except for a small role in mars attacks ! ) , but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one . \\nexpect to see her name floating around the oscar nominations ( and hopefully she will even be able to nab one ) . \\n'\n",

      "bin chocolat  a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures  patterns  and lines  hoping shell be able to foresee the kind of chocolate theyll most enjoy  nsome scoff the idea  but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next  revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before  nthis can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole  on the surface  it appears to be a light  fluffy fable with no depth or true worth  but when one takes a second  deeper look  chocolats true colors begin to shine through  nmaking a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it  lasse hallstroms chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously craftednot to mention one of the best films of the year  nwhat gives chocolat its magic  much like hallstroms  winner of two academy awards  the cider house rules  is its willingness to say whats on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences  nthe bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers  but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrowmindedness  nchocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet  where majority rules  and the majority lives by only one law  religion  nthe bulk of the townspeople  with few exceptions  are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence  lent  but when the independent thinking  seemingly nonreligious vianne rocher  juliette binoche  and her daughter anouk  victoire thivisol  make the village their home  the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouthwatering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens  nmany are predictably opposed and deeply offended by viannes opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent  especially the mayor  comte de reynaud  a cartoonlike alfred molina   who will stop at nothing to put her out of business  non the other hand  the shop is a delight to others  including the cranky armande voizin  judi dench   who sits day by day in viannes shop  telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson  aurelien parentkoening   which comes as a result of his mother  carrieann moss  believing armande is a bad influence  as she does not hold the same  strict religious beliefs that she does  nalso a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat  whose husband is constantly beating her  to whom vianne offers a home and befriends  njuliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne  genuinely capturing her characters determination to turn the narrowminded townspeople into more happy  independent human beings  but most of chocolats success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses  nlena olin  previously nominated for an oscar in   deserves her second nomination for her earnest  moving portrayal of a lost  scared woman torn between staying true to her battering  manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs  njudi dench is sharp  incisive  and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin  ncarrie annmoss  in what is likely to be her first largely noticed  and acclaimed  role since the matrix  shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen  crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously  nvictoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk  a young girl hoping her alwaysonthemove mother will eventually settle down  na trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline   five extraordinary women  one extraordinary movie   nthats not to say the men dont do their share  though  alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist  hugh oconor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is  and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux  who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne  nthe technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board  lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care  perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film  ncinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric  fairy tale look to the film  and rachel portmans masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules  nchocolat  adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel  is a wonderful little treat of a film  one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter  and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter  nwhile not as powerful as the cider house rules  lasse hallstroms chocolat is a film which works on all levelsas a drama  a comedy  a fable  a romance  and a fairy tale  nand it even lives up to its name  it is delicious to savor the taste of  easy to digest  and  like all excellent chocolate  it is memorable for days afterward  nthe bottom line  chocolat is pure pleasure  n\n",

      "bin the wake of the smashing success of  rumble in the bronx   its looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release  nrumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii  nthe version i have is a copy from the laserdisc  its widescreen and bilinguallysubtitled  as are most hong kong films these days  navailability over here in the united states is very limited  these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng  nthe subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read  the letters are white and a bit small  nalthough the american release will almost certainly be dubbed  this review is of the subtitled version  so please keep that in mind if youre reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it  nto be fair  i must admit that ive never been very fond of  periodpiece  martial arts moviesthe ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past  nperhaps its because most of those ive seen were filmed on inferior stock  with either butchered dubbing or allbutillegible subtitling  or perhaps its because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and  in many cases  all but nonexistant  nin fact  many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end  nor  for that matter  it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings  armour of god  rumble in the bronx  etc   tend to have more spectacular stunts  often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions  whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts  nhaving said that  i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above  is one of the better martial arts films ive seen  and i quite enjoyed it  nsurprised  nwell  so was i  ndrunken master ii is about a young man named wong feihong  played by jackie chan  who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu  nwhere he learned this style is uncertain  as his father  wong keiying  ti lung  is steadfast in his opposition to feihongs practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu  napparently  feihong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore  rather like paul bunyan is for americans  but ive heard very little about this  and could quite well be wrong  so ill leave analysis of that to the people who know it better  none of my friends points out that the character of wong feihong is also featured in the  once upon a time in china  movies  but i have not yet seen those  nthe plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy  as are the plots to many such films  but if youre watching a jackie chan film  odds are you arent expecting something on the order of  war and peace   nthe story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics  and hence  chinas cultural heritage  while overworking  underpaying  and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill  nhowever  this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the filmfeihongs perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend  supplicate his father  keep his  pregnant  mother  played by anita mui  from fighting  and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs  nthe macguffin that drives the plot  s  is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners  nin the beginning  feihong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identicallywrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer  nin the process  he clashes with another thief  who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng  nafter feihong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners lackies  thanks to some timely intervention by a generals son  a cameo appearance by andy lau  who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii    comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when feihong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng  nand so it goes  nand the plot thickens later on  such as when feihongs girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival  or when feihong and the thief  now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners  are attacked en masse  another grand kungfu movie tradition   but i think ive already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves  nlets move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies    the naction  ntheres plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie    of ncourse  in a kung fu film  thats to be expected  nhowever  this isnt just another kung fu movie  this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography  and jackie chan is a genius  nthe primary martial arts  style  featured in the film is drunken boxing  a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk  nfurther  for the purposes of this film at least  drunken boxers fight better when they actually are intoxicated    but ntheres a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor  nunder normal circumstances  the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid  but jackie pulls it off with flair  nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper  so ill just say that the fightsespecially the big climactic fight at the endin themselves make the movie worth watching  nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work  neven without motor vehicles  well  not counting a train   there are some remarkable stunts in this film  namong other things  jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . \\n ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) \\nunlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . \\ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( \" a better tomorrow \" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the \" heroic trio \" series , \" rumble in the bronx \" ) . \\nthe performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . \\nthe scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong\\'s father\\'s back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong\\'s mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband\\'s anger away from fei-hong ) . \\njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he\\'s in fine form all through drunken master ii . \\nas far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . \\nit\\'s nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . \\nthe picture is crisp and clear . \\none thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i\\'ve ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . \\n ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) \\nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . \\ndrunken master ii shows the full potential of \" period piece \" kung fu movies , and it\\'s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . \\nthe plot does meander a bit , but that\\'s to be expected in this type of film . \\nif you like this kind of movie , you\\'ll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . \\nif nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . \\n'\n"

      "berrol morris  critically acclaimed director of the  documentary fast  cheap and out of control  vaults to new heights with mr  ndeath  nthis film  an examination of the life and work of controversial execution equipment designer and revisionist historian fred a  leuchter  jr   is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise  stunning even the more jaded minds among us  ndont let the films cheesy dissuade you  nfollowing this sideshow of horrorlab special effects we are plunged quickly into a nonstop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchters life and mind  nmorris follows the trail of leuchters madness with appalling lucidity  revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with  this leuchter guy is seriously messed up  nvirtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls  leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession  designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries  in spite of his lack of credentials  nafter a moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows  leuchter came to the attention of neonazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel  who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his theory that the holocaust never happened  nmorriss interviews are surprisingly congenial  drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves  nzundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch  nleuchter seems completely at ease  sometimes jovial  npart of this effect may be due to morriss new interviewing machine  called the interrotron  which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer  nthis was the first time morris had used the device  and the results are startling  ncombine the irony of these interviews with leuchters reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau  not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant  and youve got one compelling and disturbing documentary  nwhile this film isnt for the feebleminded or weakhearted  it is a valuable addition to the cultural landscape  naside from a few dragging minutes toward the end of the piece  morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject and i  for one  feel bettered by the experience  n\n",

      "bi recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years  nit was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood  nbut of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years  i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex  nyes  more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me  trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster  nfor all teenagers  its almost like a rite of passage  nand what we did was sometimes downright nasty  sometimes funny  and sometimes shocking  nand all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer  namerican pie is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year  njust how great are their hormones raging  none of them notes  after watching disneys the little mermaid  that ariel is soooo hot  nthe four schoolmates are kevin  oz  finch and jim  nkevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend  but doesnt want to have sex until the time is just right  nbut what is the perfect time  nthere is just no way to know  and that frightens him  noz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive  nhe joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages  nfinch is the phobic hermit who doesnt stand a chance with any girl  nso  he pays someone  to start spreading rumors about his prowess  nsuddenly  girls are lining up to go out with him  nbut among these friends  it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful  nwhen he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student  his inexperience comes shining through  nhe has much to learn  and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge  nthis may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with moms apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking  raunchy  yet unbelievably funny  nthe one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its r rating  nthere is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that theres something about mary was gloriously ribald  nin fact  at first this film received a sinful nc rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teenaccessible rating  nbut i guess after seeing the noholdsbarred coarseness of south park  this seems tame by comparison  nteens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest  nbut unlike many teen sex comedies  there is a genuine intelligence at work here  nthese are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex  ntheir plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences  nthey know what they want  yet temper it with responsibility  nbut almost always  its impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster  and its these episodes that make american pie such a carnal delight to watch  n\n",

      "blets get this one over with as quickly as possible  nif there was a possibility to receive a refund  this review would not be forthcoming  nbut as it is   godzilla  is without a doubt the loudest  longest  and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio  nproducer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves  and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch  last year at merienbad  until they can grasp the idea of content and plot  nno amount of hype  no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the s equivalent to william beaudine  billy the kid vs  ndracula   n  godzilla  opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs  nwe are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship  a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins   nwell  the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature  nlater  a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache  jean reno  interview the sole survivor  nin a state of shock  the only thing the man can utter is the word  gojira   the japanese name of the famed beast   nwe are then introduced to dr  nick tatopoulos  matthew broderick  with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film   nhe is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population  nhe is immediately drafted by the u  s  military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature  nin a short amount of time  another fishing boat  loaded with canned tuna from the u  s  and korea for some reason  is found grounded in jamaica  nwell  it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york  nwhen the beast finally appears  he tears up one building  stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert  thumbs up for new york   nthe military  with dr  tatopouloss help  have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system  nit finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr  tatopoulos who snaps the beasts picture  nthe monster eats the fish  the military starts shooting  and the chase is on  with the army causing  of the ensuing damage  nworking from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple  dr  totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open  even though new york has been evacuated   nwell the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant  nneedless to say  no one believes the good doctor about his discovery  so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monsters nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city  even though the monster isnt dead yet   ni sincerely hope that ive completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film  ni gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous  or foolish  enough to drop down an hours wage on this tripe  neverything about  godzilla  reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast  nthe script  and lets be clear here  by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years  razzie  award  nthe dialogue between maria pitillo  as audrey timmonds  dr  tatopoulos estranged girlfriend  and mr  broderick is so adolescent  it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief  as happened during the screening i witnessed   nthe film could be enjoyably campy if it didnt take itself so damn seriously  nbut to what end  as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature  nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind  nno  godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it  nthe film is bleak and ugly looking  ntaking place at night during a rain storm  the movie has little or no depth  neverything is ugly and dark  nnew york has never looked so inhospitable since  death wish   nin an attempt to give the film some color  audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue  nthe only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica  where dr  tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint  nthe scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up  nyou know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint  nfor a scientist  this is very poor observation  nlets look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film  this activity  is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game   n   why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs  and how do those eggs fuse into one beast  n   why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate  such as new york  to nest  ni dont think iguanas have a habit of migrating  n   how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system  slice a submarine in half  yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin  in comparison  steel cable on the brooklyn bridge  n   the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need its suspension cables  n   did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly  nif so  then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures  n  note  each egg is  feet tall and almost as wide  ngodzilla would have to be over    feet tall to carry them all   n   godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters  but new york cabs are made of stronger steel  n7 . ) godzilla can out maneuver helicopters , bullets , torpedoes and missiles , but can\\'t catch you on foot . \\n8 . ) taxis can out maneuver godzilla . \\n9 . ) godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can\\'t tear through the park avenue tunnel . \\n10 . ) why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ? \\nmaybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel . \\n11 . ) galapagos iguana\\'s actually live in the french polynesian islands ? \\n12 . ) why was dr . tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway ? \\n13 . ) how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day , and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey ? \\n14 . ) new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting . \\nnew yorkers hate beta cam . \\ni could go on and on , but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is . \\ndon\\'t be fooled , this film has less gray matter than any episode of \" america\\'s funniest home videos \" . \\nthe performances in the film are singularly bland . \\nnot one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror . \\nthe characters , in the midst of the onslaught , have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee , failed relationships , career choices . \\nthe only common occurrence that doesn\\'t take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement , but then that would have made them believable . \\ngodzilla for the most part is okay . \\nthe design of the beast is funky , if not very memorable . \\none thing that comes to mind-- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark , namely his atomic breath . \\nnow , i for one can\\'t quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait . \\na good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly . \\nthere is so much wrong with this film that i can\\'t really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my divorce ) . \\nany film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac . \\nthe addition of the baby raptors ( ah , i meant godzillas ) , are nothing but a direct rip off of \\'jurassic park \" , but with none of that film\\'s suspense or tension . \\nsuffice to say that , \" godzilla \" is without a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade . \\nthis is a film that needed the hype . \\nwith the current level of writing and directing , nothing else about the film succeeds . \\nif you\\'ve seen the trailers , you\\'ve seen the best parts . \\nmy only suggestion for mr . d and mr . e . is that they could always go back to selling shoes . \\n . this film could be the next \" rocky horror \" . \\nonly it\\'s not funny ! \\n'\n"

him to sink in an eternal catatonia  nthe police  led by fbi agent peter novak  vince vaughn  are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victims body  but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state  nin a last ditch attempt  they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering starghers mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell    na cell which will completely fill with water in the next  hours  ninitial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix  nwhile it does share some characteristics with both films  particularly the first forty minutes  which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs   the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm  nthe buzz around this project is that firsttime feature film director tarsem singh  who won many awards for his video of r  e  m  s  losing my religion   wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story  and a good portion of this film supports that theory  ndespite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments  the cell does feature some remarkable imagery  nall of the sequences where we delve into someones mind are incredibly beautiful  including the dank mind of stargher  whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h  r  giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video   proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe  nthe first sequence that takes place in starghers mind is by far the best  featuring one of the most ingenious traps ive ever seen in a film  involving a horse  which no one seeing this film will probably forget   a zoolike display of starghers victims which are animated like marionettes  and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room  nif the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant  but alas  the sequences only become more silly as they go along  despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film   nthe cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images  but at least vincent donofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance  magnified by ten  thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed   nin my opinion  donofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film  but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful  i  e   nthe newton boys  feeling minnesota  the thirteenth floor  and the velocity of gary  that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him  nthe character of stargher is an excellent role for him though  and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him  ndetractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film  as it contains heavy doses of both  nbesides the nipple ring removal i mention above  there is also starghers penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs  prior to his catatonia and capture  which will have audiences recoiling  na sequence where catherine enters starghers mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting  none moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spitlike device  nas a narrative film  the cell is sorely lacking  nas a collection of images though  the cell is extremely well done  nalthough the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half  singh has done what he supposedly set out to do  make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together  nunfortunately  a wellwritten script should have been considered too  because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv  provided  of course  that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos   n\n",
      "bif beavis and butthead had a favorite movie  from dusk till dawn would probably be it  nscripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez  desperado   the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence  and is incredibly fun to watch  nit starts off as a pulp fictiontype crime story  with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing a convenience store  nbecause this is a tarantino movie  however  its not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot  its a case of a hole being shot through someones hand  a man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away  nthe opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie  everything overdone and nothing as it seems  nclooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it  nharvey keitel plays the backslidden expreacher and juliette lewis his daughter  whom registered sexpervert tarantino eyes endlessly  nyou know youre mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive  although shes not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn  nthe first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border  clooneys strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet  nit does its trick  the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind  never noticing clooney or tarantino  nonce they get to mexico  its time to wait at the rendezvous point  a topless bar called titty twister where were once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper  nfinally  after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis to drink with him  the stripper turns into a vampire  nsoon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back  nthats right  weve come all this way to see a vampire movie  nbut like everything else  tarantino takes this ageold genre and twists it to his own ends to produce overthetop entertainment  nso we get holy water condom balloons  heads rolling  quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten by a vampire and announcing he only has a few minutes left before he becomes  a lap dog of satan   nthe from dusk till dawn dialogue is  tarantino  hovering between absurd and disgusting  as when theyre entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister   but always entertaining  and is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more secondrate gorefest  nclooney  keitel and especially tarantino are so overthetop with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious  ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously  nstuff like this would be terrible in any other movie  but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people  even if theres absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn  npulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason  but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment  nfrom dusk till dawn isnt the classic of modern cinema that pf is  but is does prove you can do a good job making a really bad movie  n\n",
